Nasional Bhd have received the approval of Bank Negara to commence negotiations under the first phase of the government’s proposed merger involving the country’s development financial institutions (DFIs).</p> <p>BPMB in a statement said that negotiations between the two DFIs are expected to be completed within six months from Bank Negara’s approval.</p> <p>In Budget 2020, the government had proposed to merge four DFIs, namely, BPMB, Danajamin, Export-Import Bank of Malaysia Bhd (Exim Bank) and Small Medium Enterprise Development Bank Malaysia Bhd (SME Bank) to strengthen the development finance ecosystem via a two-phased restructuring plan to form a new financial institution.</p> <p>The first phase of the restructuring plan will involve the merger of BPMB with Danajamin, and the second phase to merge Exim Bank and SME Bank into the earlier merged entity.</p> <p>The smooth implementation of the restructuring plan would be overseen by a steering committee, led by the Finance Ministry.</p> <p>The steering committee consists of representatives from Credit Guarantee Corp Malaysia Bhd, Bank Negara and the four DFIs, as well as relevant stakeholder ministries including the Economic Affairs Ministry, the Entrepreneur Development Ministry and the International Trade and Industry Ministry.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a working committee, which would provide updates on the merger progress, would also support the steering committee in driving the implementation of the key integration aspects of the merger.</p> <p>Given the expected merger of the four DFIs, a banking analyst from Kenanga Research told StarBiz that the merger is expected to largely tap the financing for entrepreneurs as well as SMEs, driven by BPMB’s mandate to provide medium and long-term financing to the strategic sectors of the economy.</p> <p>“Right now, getting financing for the SME sector is tough, given the weak business sentiment.</p> <p>“Hence, conventional banks see the SME market and unsecured businesses as high risk to provide financing.</p> <p>“However, this merger would extend its financing to the SME business which is a big market as it faces difficulty in getting financing from conventional banks, ” he added.</p> <p>Overall, SME lending is seeing faster growth than total loan growth this year, according to MIDF Research senior analyst Imran Yassin.</p> <p>BPMB was incorporated in 1973 with the role of assisting entrepreneurs involved in SME industries through the provision of various financing facilities, training and advisory services, particularly to bumiputra entrepreneurs.Through its wholly owned subsidiary Pembangunan Leasing Corp Sdn Bhd (PLC), BPMB also provides financing to SME businesses including those involved in manufacturing, construction, supply, transportation, agriculture, hospitality and information technology.</p> <p>As of Dec 31,2018, BPMB had a combined asset value of RM24.7bil, reflecting that the group is well-positioned to meet the financing and business development needs of Malaysian businesses in the priority sectors.</p> <p>With the global economy slowing down, the analyst noted that merging Danajamin could be useful in the merger, as the bank would be able to capitalise the banking system should there be a rise in non-performing loans, moving forward.</p> <p>“This merger would strengthen the capital adequacy ratio, so it can continue to expand its lending to the SME sector and unsecured businesses, ” he added.</p> <p>The government’s proposal to merge four DFIs in the country could create an entity with a larger balance sheet that, in turn, could result in greater efficiencies and better cost controls.</p> <p>However, with these institutions serving different mandates, the operational side would be something that the government would need to address, according to industry players.</p> <p>Another likely issue that could crop up with the proposed merger is staffing, where there will bound to be duplications and overlaps in some operations, post-merger.</p> <p>Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said in his Budget 2020 presentation that DFIs played an important role as public institutions that support the nation’s development goals and serve the needs and requirements of the new economy.</p> <p>The possible merger of local DFIs in Malaysia’s already crowded and competitive banking space had been discussed sometime back, but did not take off.</p> <p>Previously, in a statement issued by BPMB, it said that the proposal to strengthen the DFI eco-system is a “positive development.”</p> <p>“Our business lines are complementary to the other institutions, and the proposal will lead to greater synergies that would benefit all stakeholders, as well as fulfil the needs of the new economy, ” it added.</p> <p>DFIs in Malaysia were established in the 1960s and 1970s as specialised financial institutions with specific mandates to develop strategic sectors, spanning agriculture, infrastructure, SMEs, as well as export-oriented and high-technology industries.</p> <p>Notably, in 2008, SME Bank was made a separate entity from its parent company, the BPMB group.</p> <p>For the year ended Dec 31,2018, BPMB’s net profit fell 21.5% to RM167.31mil, due to higher allowance for impairment losses on loans and financing of RM423.22mil versus RM302.78mil a year earlier.</p> <p>Last year, Bank Negara collaborated with the World Bank and DFIs to develop an enhanced performance measurement framework for DFIs.</p> <p>The central bank said it sought to provide a sharper focus in the mandates of DFIs, while optimising performance and synergies.</p> <p>It aims to capture the broader contributions of DFIs by moving beyond the narrow focus of financing growth indicators, and integrating developmental key performance indicators to measure the socio-economic impact of DFI operations.</p>\n",

As a development financial institution (DFI), Agrobank’s business activities have always centered on community development and entrepreneurial development.</p> <p>“Through Agro Nisaa’-i, we hope that more women agropreneurs would be empowered to start successful agri-related businesses, ” she said.</p> <p>Khadijah said this was in line with its mandated role to provide financial facilities in assisting the unserved and underserved community, especially the B40 community.</p> <p>The facilities would provide agropreneurs in starting and growing their businesses. Through this initiative, Agrobank hopes that Agro Nisaa’-i will help to improve the quality of life for women agropreneurs.</p> <p>Recently, Agrobank launched a collaboration with National Fishermen's Association (NEKMAT) by providing Agro Nisaa’-i financing to 200 fishermen’s wives to start their agri-business.</p> <p>The objective, acording to the bank, was to help communities to improve their socioeconomic status especially during the monsoon season.</p> <p>Guidance, advisory as well as peer support to these participants on financial management and expenditure were also provided in this financing programme.</p> <p>Agrobank said it was committed to ensure that agropreneurs are not just equipped with the adequate financing needed for their business but also the right knowledge to manage the business well.</p> <p> </p>\n",

      "                A WEEK before the tabling of Budget 2020, this column highlighted that the budget will likely be a non-event as far as the market is concerned for the simple reason that the government’s finances are tight and it cannot simply afford the many wishes of the wide range of stakeholders.<br/><br/>While economic projections came within expectations, especially with respect to the budget deficit target of 3.2% and development expenditure of RM56bil, the projected revenue and expenditure were off by 4% each as they came in higher than expected.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the projected current balance of RM3.5bil was just slightly above the forecast RM3bil.<br/><br/>The Budget 2020 tabled last week is looking at economic growth of 4.8%, which is within the expected range of between 4.5% and 5%. It will be challenging, given the expected growth is to be mainly driven by private consumption, smaller contraction in public investment and but dragged by a drop in net exports as imports growth is expected to surpass exports next year. On the supply side, the significant contribution from the construction sector growth is not a surprise given some of the mega projects will likely kick off next year, while the services sector too is expected to be sustained at more than 6% growth.<br/><br/>Budget 2020 had several hits and misses. While it raised minimum wage to RM1,200, it is still short of the RM1,500 target.<br/><br/>At the same time the call to widen the tax revenue base was not fulfilled. The introduction of a new tax bracket of 30% for high income earners of above RM2mil a year is insufficient as it is only an incremental increase of two percentage points. The Finance Minister failed to introduce, or at least prepare Malaysians, to accept new taxes, especially Inheritance Tax and Capital Gains Tax.<br/><br/>The property market got a major boost with the lowering of the threshold price to RM600,000 from RM1mil for completed high rise condominiums and apartments that can be sold to foreign buyers beginning next year for a period of one year.<br/><br/>Hopefully, this would help developers sitting on these types of properties and to clear the existing overhang in the market. In addition, the Rent-To-Own scheme is good for first-time home buyers while the change in the base year for the purposes of Real Property Gains Tax (RPGT) to the year 2013 from 2000 is a welcome relief, although still not widely accepted. For administrative purposes, it is always better to calculate RPGT to the year the property is purchased and not any base year as valuation of a property at a given point of time in history is very subjective.<br/><br/>Budget 2020 was a positive surprise for those in the technology and in the electrical and electronics (E&amp;E) sector while the sin sectors were obviously sparred this time around, with the exception of a reduction in special draws for the number forecasting operators (NFO). The proposed merger of the four Development Financial Institutions (DFI) was another surprise and hopefully when that is done, the merged entity will be the next mega IPO to be listed on Bursa Malaysia.<br/><br/>For the environment as well as to promote green initiatives, the proposals made under the Budget are indeed welcome and could spur renewal energy further. With the target to achieve 20% of energy production by 2025, the introduction of a 70% income tax exemption of up to 10 years to companies undertaking solar leasing activities could spur higher demand among consumers.<br/><br/>But this could only happen if prices of solar panels became more attractive and the cost savings from the income tax reliefs are actually passed on to consumers. The problem among consumers is the upfront cost of putting up solar panels on their roofs as it can be as high as almost RM4,000 per KW peak or kWp.<br/><br/>Malaysia is also expected to see an accelerated pace of investments flowing into the country as the government’s move to establish a special channel via InvestKL to attract investments from China is seen positive. Despite a temporary truce to the US-China trade war over the weekend, nothing is certain just yet as to how the trade tariffs will pan out over the next few weeks. Placing Malaysia as a destination of choice for foreign direct investments is crucial as it signals our readiness in attracting long term investments which can create job opportunities and generate economic expansion. The setting up of the National Committee on Investment (NCI) is also a step in the right direction to spur and expedite inward investment activities.<br/><br/>The Budget 2020 was indeed a comprehensive document covering all Malaysians and indeed what better way than to focus on two main critical issues – cost of living and jobs.<br/><br/>The budget did not fail in this aspect as there were various incentives to address cost of living issues, including the newly introduced fuel subsidy mechanism, a free RM30 e-wallet deposit into accounts of entitled persons and last but not least, a 18% reduction for PLUS highway users effective New Year’s Day next year.<br/><br/>The toll issue has dragged on for far too long and with the tabling of the Budget 2020, we are now seeing some light at the end of the tunnel. When the Minister highlighted that the 18% reduction in toll translates to about RM1.13bil, it seems to suggest that the current shareholders of PLUS, the EPF and Khazanah, are likely to forgo any future dividends with the reduction.<br/><br/>With the commitment from the government that extension period for toll concessionaires is not going to be extended, it is likely the two or three proposals that are siting on the desk of the Minister or the Prime Minister will continue to collect dust.<br/><br/>Their proposals, while entailing even larger discounts than that proposed by the Minister, lack the commitment to end tolling in 2038. Hence, it is likely that their proposals are not going to see the light of day. Given the unspoken line, it is now likely that either Khazanah or the EPF to take the lead to buy out one or the other. Logically, as the ability to pay dividends to shareholders has now be diminished, it would make sense for Khazanah to acquire the 49% not already owned from EPF.<br/><br/>All in, the Budget 2020 was a comprehensive document towards the government’s new mantra towards Shared Prosperity Vision 2030. It was, for once, a budget for the people and inclusive as well as far reaching. Kudos to the Pakatan Harapan government. Well done!<br/><br/>Now, the tough and hard part – to implement the proposals as promised.<br/><br/><strong>The views expressed here are the writer’s own.</strong>\n",

To answer this question, Oxfam and Development Finance International (DFI) released the second index ‘to measure the commitment of governments to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor’. </p> <p>The index covers 157 countries and ranks them on the basis of their social spending, progressive taxation and labour rights – three areas found to be critical to reducing the gap.</p> <p>In Asia, Japan ranks the highest in terms of investing towards reducing the gap between the rich and the poor. </p> <p>Japan ranked 11 globally is the only Asian country to figure in top twenty. It has considerably increased its tax collection and significantly increased minimum wages as well.</p> <p>South Korea ranked 58 globally is second in Asia in its commitment to reducing inequality.The country has significantly improved in all three areas that the index considers to measure the commitment. The country has increased the minimum wage by 16.4 per cent. It has also increased the taxation on the profitable corporations as well as increased spending.</p> <p>Mongolia ranks third in Asia and 58 globally. </p> <p>The country has substantially increased taxation for high earners to reduce the inequality. </p> <p>It is followed by Thailand ranked fourth in Asia and 74 globally.Malaysia and China is ranked 75 and 81 respectively.

However, it will take time (for them to change),\" he added.</p> <p>When contacted, political analyst Koh Kok Wee pointed out that in the past year, medium- and low-income earners in Malaysia generally faced the problem of rising cost of living and stagnant wages, which did not improve much even after GE14.</p> <p>\"The previous tax-free window was rather short and prices of goods have not dropped significantly after the implementation of SST,\" he said.</p> <p>As focus was more on the B40 group, Koh noted that the government should not ignore the predicaments faced by the middle-income group that are often neglected.</p> <p>He said that medical and healthcare expenses have been an increasingly heavy burden for them, and the government must consider if they intend to cut down on subsidies.</p> <p>Universiti Sains Malaysia political science lecturer Dr Azmil Tayeb pointed out that there was hardly any mention of stronger social welfare net for the poor in the review.</p> <p>\"For example, is there any plan for unemployment benefits for those who lose their jobs? Or job retraining programmes?</p> <p>\"Second, while it is laudable to increase income and purchasing power, the reality now is starkly different. Minimum income is raised to merely RM1,050, which is a far cry from RM4,790 median income for the B40 group,\" he said.</p> <p>Dr Azmil said the decreasing dependence of people on government assistance could mean that the government is abdicating its responsibility to care for the poor and needy by passing it on to the private sector.</p> <p>\"I think this will not bode well for the poor and needy.</p> <p>\"Thus, a stronger social welfare net should be established to ensure no one falls through the cracks in hard times,\" he said.</p> <p>Universiti Malaysia Sarawak political analyst Assoc Prof Dr Jeniri Amir said that the government should focus on closing the disparity between people living in different states by looking into underdeveloped regions.</p> <p>\"The government must first understand the needs of the marginalised groups in order to meaningfully tackle rising costs of living,\" he said.</p> <p>Dr Jeniri also noted that government's intention to build 200,000 affordable houses for the remaining plan period was not adequate because affordable housing is in high demand.</p> <p>\"The locations for affordable housing and healthcare facilities should be appropriate and strategic,\" he said, adding that more of these should be built in rural areas.</p> <p>The Asian Strategy and Leadership Institute's Centre for Public Policy Studies senior director Lau Zheng Zhou said the government should also adopt a demand-driven approach in addressing some of the issues and challenges.</p> <p>\"For example, on the issue of affordable housing, the government should recognise that changes in demand such as job mobility and the rise of gig economy may result in greater need for a strong rental market, not necessarily homeownership via buying affordable houses,\" he said.</p> <p>The government should also realign the role of government-linked companies (GLCs) towards socio-economic development rather than having wide presence in the Malaysian economy, resulting in smaller private enterprises to be less competitive.</p> <p>Lau said the government should promote technology and knowledge transfer via partnerships with foreign firms as means to develop competitiveness for the economy of the future, rather than focusing too much on short-term subsidies to boost spending.</p> <p>\"The development of new industries such as renewable energy or rolling stock manufacturing through greenfield investment by foreign companies should be promoted.</p> <p>Malaysia has the potential to be the regional hub and stronger emphasis on the manufacturing sector can address the issue of premature de-industrialisation,\" he added.</p> <p>He also opined that the government should focus on the strengthening the roles of development financing institutions (DFI) in addressing future demand and work towards meeting United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals.</p>\n",

The lack of deep pockets and resources can often be a roadblock in their expansion plans. </p> <p>But the growth of SMEs over the past few years has caught the eye of the finance sector. Banks are more willing to take risks with SMEs as they, too, are eager to bank on the expansion of small businesses.</p> <p>“SMEs are a backbone of the economy and Bank Negara places a high priority on ensuring that we have a very comprehensive ecosystem for SME financing,” says Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) deputy governor Jessica Chew. </p> <p>These days, there a many more avenues for SMEs to seek funds to finance different types of expansion.

Additionally, most of them still need support in terms of financial management and in their preparation of documentation to apply for financing.</p> <p>But there are ample financing sources, says Chew, and there are efforts to develop nontraditional sources of funding to continue supporting enterprises at all stages of the business life-cycle.</p> <p><strong>Traditional banks</strong></p> <p>Not too long ago, the SMEs were considered an undesirable segment as bankers preferred to go after more sizeable corporate business. Also, SMEs were viewed as a risky segment.</p> <p>However, consumer products have become highly competitive and margins from large corporate business have also dropped.</p> <p>Consequently, banking institutions have been progressively increasing their business to SMEs. Small businesses are now the new class of customers.</p> <p>According to Chew, almost 50% of the banking system lend to SMEs, which is a huge improvement from just six years ago when SMEs make up about 40% of the total financing from financial institutions.</p> <p> </p><div class=\"embeded-image inline-image-center\"><img alt=\"New growth area: SMEs have become a favourable class of customers as financial institutions look to expand in this segment.\" src=\"https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/36D9D9A2-B28A-4F9C-ABBE-5AAD0DB87CB0\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 404px;\"/> <div class=\"inline-caption\">New growth area: SMEs have become a favourable class of customers as financial institutions look to expand in this segment. </div> </div> <p>She adds that 97% of SME financing actually come from banks. </p> <p>The SME market in Malaysia currently has over RM300bil in assets, including in loans, reserves and investment securities.</p> <p>Banks have come to acknowledge the big potential that this segment offers and how it can contribute to the growth of the bank.</p> <p>The SME sector has been steadily growing over 6% annually and some segments of the sector, particularly those involved with logistics and e-commerce, are still booming. </p> <p>This also means a robust customer base for banks as companies seek funds to expand. </p> <p>All this attention is good for SMEs. When there’s more competition, there will be more innovative products and cheaper solutions for them.</p> <p>Where financial institutions were previously only lending to companies with at least three years of track record, in recent years, they have increased their risk appetite for startups, particularly those with viable business plans. </p> <p>Chew also points out that the rejection rate for younger companies is not significantly higher than those with more years of operation. The rejection rate for companies below three years of operation is 21% while the rejection rate for companies with more than 10 years of operation is 16%.</p> <p> </p><div class=\"embeded-image inline-image-center\"><img alt=\"Backbone of the economy: SMEs need a supportive financing ecosystem to grow.\" src=\"https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/C342A5D9-2175-45B9-9D54-839E7DA96A5B\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 357px;\"/> <div class=\"inline-caption\">Backbone of the economy: SMEs need a supportive financing ecosystem to grow.</div> </div> <p>“Banks are becoming more familiar with SMEs, hence, they are more open to these companies,” she says.</p> <p>The impairment ratio for the industry is also relatively low at 3.4%.</p> <p>And with the market growing, some banks are expecting SMEs to contribute up to 20%-25% to group revenue by 2020.</p> <p>Apart from commercial banks, SMEs also have the option of looking at products offered by development finance institutions (DFI) such as SME Bank and Exim Bank. </p> <p>Bank Negara also has its Bank Negara SME fund, which currently stands at RM3bil, that small businesses can tap into.

We really need to develop this segment of financing market for SMEs. </p> <p>“In advanced countries like the US, for example, alternative financing can be upwards of 20% of all financing for SMEs. But in our market, it’s only 3.4%. Alternative financing has a very small share here,” says Chew.</p> <p>Notably, the take-up of alternative financing methods by small businesses is low at the moment. But as public awareness on alternative financing avenues trends upwards, businesses will increasingly look towards these avenues to finance their growth.</p> <p>Apart from ECF, P2P and Leap, which draw funds from the public, private equity and venture capital firms are also showing increased interest in funding SMEs. Such firms would not only provide funding for small businesses, but also access to networks and mentoring.</p> <p>In the Financial Stability and Payment Systems Report 2016 by BNM, it is noted that there remains significant room to support the development of alternative finance in Malaysia. </p> <p>According to the report, in 2015, key outstanding alternative financing, which encompasses venture capital, leasing and factoring, and crowdfunding, amounted to RM3.3bil compared against RM25.1bil in total SME financing applications that were rejected by banks. </p> <p>“This suggests an estimated financing gap of RM21.8bil that could potentially be met by alternative finance.</p> <p> </p><div class=\"embeded-image inline-image-center\"><img alt=\"Alternatives: A screen shot depicting an example of a kickstarter as alternative financing which can make up more than 20 of all financing for SMEs.\" src=\"https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/D44A0DF1-25F6-47F0-A13B-D9651CD0FF52\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 339px;\"/> <div class=\"inline-caption\">Alternatives: A screen shot depicting an example of a kickstarter as alternative financing which can make up more than 20 of all financing for SMEs. </div> </div> <p>“For example, the gap between the current volume of factoring and leasing in Malaysia (at 0.64% and 0.69% of GDP respectively) and global average factoring and leasing volumes in more developed countries (at 4.55% and 1.55% of GDP respectively) points to further opportunities for an additional RM48bil in financing that could be raised for Malaysian SMEs through factoring and leasing facilities,” said the report. </p> <p>The report also noted that alternative finance models are also increasingly leveraged on digital platforms, further increasing their efficiency and potential to address financing gaps in the economy.</p> <p>Chew says there are efforts to develop other forms of alternative financing in Malaysia. </p> <p>She points to a recent consultative document released by the Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM) late last year, for example, which looks into plans to introduce a collateral registry. </p> <p>“If you have machinery, for example, you can do leasing instead. You can also pledge that machinery so that people who lend can secure a collateral and be more willing to lend. So this paper will be important to kick-start this financing by movable assets. </p> <p>“A lot these SMEs have machinery which they can pledge but banks don’t accept machinery as collateral now. So this will unlock some of the assets that SMEs have to get financing,” she explains.</p> <p>“What is important now is to come together to drive alternative financing and take this to the next level. We do believe an authority to drive this is needed. We see the change in our economy and these new businesses are evolving and the need for this is more pressing. </p> <p>“This is something that we have brought up in our discussions with the government and our counterparts to be priority in the next phase,” she adds.</p> <p> </p><div class=\"embeded-image inline-image-center\"><img alt=\"Be proactive: Yap urges SMEs to apply for grants and schemes that have been allocated by the government.\" src=\"https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/4757E27F-4FD5-4D61-A5D8-E43F2DB96ACC\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 490px;\"/> <div class=\"inline-caption\">Be proactive: Yap urges SMEs to apply for grants and schemes that have been allocated by the government. </div> </div> <p><strong>Government funding</strong></p> <p>The government has been very supportive of the SME sector with generous budget allocations to boost growth.</p> <p>Industry observers note that SMEs received a big boost of RM23.7bil in terms of allocation, grants, soft loans and guarantees under Budget 2018, which would help push the growth of small businesses in the country.</p> <p>“This time, we can definitely see more funding for SMEs. It is a good budget, it covers every angle,” says SME Association of Malaysia president Datuk Michael Kang.</p> <p>Among the goodies that were dished out under Budget 2018 for SMEs include RM7bil in funds under SJPP for working capital and services sector and RM1bil in government guarantee loans under SJPP to enable SMEs to automate their production.</p> <p>There was also a notable focus on exports with an allocation of, among others, RM150mil to Matrade, Mida and SME Corp for export and promotional programmes, including the much welcomed Market Development Grant (MDG). This will help SMEs expand their exports.</p> <p>Kang says these funds and incentives would help accelerate SME contribution to the country’s GDP. </p> <p>It is targeted that SMEs would contribute 41% of GDP by 2020.</p> <p>Note that there was also considerable focus given to small businesses under last year’s budget. </p> <p>While all these avenues are available to SMEs, business owners need to be proactive in seeking out information on what grants and financial help they are eligible for. </p> <p>“SMEs need to understand all the grants that are relevant to them. They need to find out what can benefit them and find out the trends in the market so that they know what types of products and services to push this year. For example, based on the focus given in the Budget, we know that there is attention given to logistics, digital and construction.</p> <p>“They need to look at themselves and plan out how they can take advantage of all this,” says YYC Group chief executive officer Datin Yap Shin Siang.</p> <p>Yap says most SMEs are wary about applying for any of the grants due to the hassle of preparing the documentation needed for the application. Additionally, most of them are of the opinion that their application would be rejected.</p> <p>“If you never try, you never know,” she says.</p>\n",

      "                KUALA LUMPUR: RAM Rating Services has assigned the AAA/Stable/P1 financial institution ratings to Small Medium Enterprise Development Bank Malaysia Bhd (SME Bank). <br/> <br/> It said on Wednesday the ratings reflected its expectation of strong government support, underscored by its strategic role in the Government of Malaysia’s (GoM) socio-economic agenda to develop the SME sector. <br/> <br/> “A development financial institution (DFI) wholly owned by the GoM, SME Bank has been mandated to support SMEs through the provision of financing and advisory services,” it said.<br/> <br/> RAM Ratings pointed out SMEs contributed 36.6% of the country’s GDP and 65.3% of its employment in 2016. <br/> <br/> Under the SME Master Plan (2012-2020), the GoM targets to increase SMEs’ contribution to GDP to 41% by 2020. <br/> <br/> As for SME Bank, it accounts for around 40% of SME financing among DFIs, though its overall market share is small. <br/> <br/> Apart from bridging the financing gap of the unserved or underserved SMEs, SME Bank is also the GoM’s conduit in developing the targeted sub-segments of the SME sector through specific financing programmes. <br/> <br/> RAM Ratings noted that government support for SME Bank followed the recent conversion of RM500mil of government borrowing into equity as well as continuous funding support from the GoM, through lending, deposit placements and guarantees. <br/> <br/> About 83% of SME Bank’s profit-bearing funds were sourced from the GoM/government-related entities or guaranteed by the GoM as at end-March 2017.<br/> <br/> “Given its public-policy role and focus on SMEs, SME Bank’s financing portfolio inherently carries a higher credit risk, which leads to an elevated gross impaired-financing ratio. <br/> <br/> “While SME Bank’s financing is largely collateralised, a sharp decline in collateral values or the non-recoverability of collateral could necessitate additional provisions given its low provision coverage. <br/> <br/> “Besides, SMEs are more vulnerable to adverse developments. As such, the uneven economic recovery presents further risks to SME Bank’s asset quality,” it said. <br/> <br/> RAM Rating said the recent conversion of RM500mil of government borrowing into equity will improve SME Bank’s loss-absorption buffer, albeit still sensitive to provisioning risk. Its Basel I core-capital ratio will be lifted to above 18% on a pro forma basis.  <br/> <br/>\n",

      "<p><strong>PNB among institutions said to be exploring the profitable co-operative bank</strong></p> <p>PETALING JAYA: Bank Rakyat, Malaysia’s profitable Islamic co-operative bank, has become a takeover target as part of Bank Negara’s bigger plan to consolidate the financial sector.</p> <p>According to sources familiar with the matter, the idea is being floated around and among the institutions exploring the takeover of Bank Rakyat is Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB). Local conventional banks are also said to be eyeing Bank Rakyat.</p> <p>“It is still at an infancy stage. It’s early days and remains an idea that is being explored,” said a source.</p> <p>PNB which is the country’s largest fund management company, has three major financial institutions in its stable and is believed to be open to the idea of acquiring Bank Rakyat in a move which could lead to value creation between Bank Rakyat and PNB-controlled companies. </p> <p>Besides the MIDF Group which is the investment banking and asset management arm of PNB, the fund also controls <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=MAYBANK\" target=\"_blank\">MALAYAN BANKING BHD</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=MAYBANK\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a> (Maybank) – the largest bank in the country that also has a regional presence.</p> <p>Other than these, PNB has a 60% stake in Malaysia’s only national reinsurer, <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=MNRB\" target=\"_blank\">MNRB HOLDINGS BHD</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=MNRB\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a> which is grossly under-valued. Bank Rakyat, meanwhile, is the biggest Islamic cooperative bank in the country with 147 branches. It had assets totalling RM99.3bil as at September last year and is the second largest Islamic financial institution after Maybank Islamic Bhd.</p> <p>Bank Rakyat is broadly defined as a development financial institution (DFI) and was established in 1954 under the Cooperative Ordinance 1948 (known as the Cooperative Societies Act 1993.</p> <p>It is an entity under the control of the Domestic Trade, Cooperatives and Consumerism Ministry. </p> <p>Apart from this, it also reports to two other parties, namely Bank Negara and the Finance Ministry. </p> <p>Bank Negara defines DFIs in Malaysia as “specialised financial institutions established by the government with specific mandate to develop and promote key sectors that are considered of strategic importance to the overall socio-economic development objectives of the country.”</p> <p>Bankers say that as a DFI, Bank Rakyat has always been viewed as a takeover target even as regulators seek to consolidate the banking sector further.</p> <p>Recall, Malaysia’s banking sector has gone through major consolidation that has seen some 55 financial institutions reduced to the current eight. More consolidation is to be expected as competition within the industry intensifies. </p> <p>At this point, it is unsure how PNB will fit Bank Rakyat in its portfolio of financial institutions, if the deal materialises.</p> <p>“The best bet would be to use MIDF as a vehicle to take over Bank Rakyat and create a big Islamic bank,” said the source. </p> <p>A merger should bode well with the central bank’s aspiration to create a mega Malaysian Islamic bank which would help cement the country’s status as the world’s largest sukuk market and a hub for Islamic finance.</p> <p>As Bank Rakyat involves individuals and cooperatives as its members as well as reports to more than one entity, it will require approvals at various levels. </p> <p>Bank Rakyat’s profits have been growing in recent years, fuelled largely by its personal financing business. </p> <p>For the financial year ending Dec 31, 2015, it recorded a pre-zakat profit of RM2.01bil. </p> <p>Personal financing accounted for the bulk of its gross financing book. </p> <p>Bank Rakyat, which recently came under focus for alleged corruption involving its chairman and managing director, is believed to have ambitions to grow its commercial banking segment.</p> <p>Last month it was reported that Bank Rakyat is looking to enter the Indonesian market in the second quarter of this year after getting approval from the authorities, including Bank Negara. </p> <p>Towards this end, the bank said, it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Indonesia’s largest bank, Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI). </p> <p>On PNB’s front, quite a bit has happened in its stable of companies since Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar took over on Aug 1 last year. Among others, <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=UMW\" target=\"_blank\">UMW HOLDINGS BHD</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=UMW\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a> in which PNB has a 56.1% stake, is divesting its interest in listed subsidiary <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=UMWOG\" target=\"_blank\">UMW Oil And Gas Corp Bhd</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=UMWOG\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a>, while <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=SIME\" target=\"_blank\">Sime Darby Bhd</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=SIME\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a>, in which PNB controls 52.8%, has proposed the listing of its plantation and property businesses to unlock value.</p>\n",

And with a presence in over 100 countries, Norzilah said, it would be able to share information about some of the potential buyers that SMEs have to deal with – a kind of background check.</p> <p>She revealed that Exim Bank’s target was to have about 70% of its customer base made up of SMEs by 2018. Currently, the figure stands at about 60%. </p> <p>“We need our SMEs to be export-ready. This include preparing themselves for the required financial reporting standards and products that meet the standards of the country that they are venturing into,” she said.</p> <p>Agreeing with Norzilah, Malaysia Retail Chain Association (MRCA) president Datuk Liaw Choon Liang said entrepreneurs needed such financing facilities to purchase the manufacturing equipment that met these standards.</p> <p>One of the financial instrument introduced by Norzilah is credit insurance, which serves to provide peace of mind for the entrepreneurs when they are doing international trade. Essentially, it’s an insurance policy that covers non-payment after the delivery of goods or services due to commercial or political risks. </p> <p>The insurance is purchased by business entities to insure their accounts receivable against losses stemming from the insolvency of overseas buyers. </p> <p>Lauding Exim Bank’s efforts, Liaw, who is also CEO and president of Focus Point Holdings Bhd, said there was more that the government could do to encourage entrepreneurs to venture overseas.</p> <p>“It is very common when entrepreneurs approach commercial banks for financing that the banks would ask for either collateral or guarantor. We are hoping that they would look at other forms of collateral, such as a company’s brand which could serve as an intellectual property (IP),” he suggested.</p> <p>Financing aside, Liaw – who had invested in China before – also talked about what being export-ready meant to him, taking into consideration the culture and buying trends of the market that an SME intends to venture into. </p> <p>He said his ACE market-listed company, which operates a chain of eyewear and eyecare products and professional eyecare centres, once opened six outlets in hypermarkets in China. However, they had all closed down within three years.</p> <p>“We were attracted with the huge population proposition of the China market, but realised later that the Chinese consumers go to hypermarkets strictly to buy groceries and not shop for glasses,” he said.</p> <p>As such, one had to know the consumer behaviour and the market one wanted to penetrate.</p> <p>With the focus now on creating a single Asean market comprising 625 million people with the Asean Economic Community (AEC), Malaysian SMEs surely could learn a thing or two from the two panelists about how to go about it.</p>\n",

      "<p><strong>Asean SMEs discuss AEC</strong></p> <p>The implications and relevance of the Asean Economic Community (AEC) on business operations and strategies, and the dissemination of information to networks and communities, were deliberated at a seminar in Bangkok last week. </p> <p>The two-day seminar on the “AEC Information for Business” discussed the importance of awareness and understanding of AEC’s key initiatives for the business community. </p> <p>Delegates included representatives from regional and national business councils, SME promotion agencies, Asean SMEs and government agencies. </p> <p>Palarin Yamchinda, director of Policy and Strategy Unit, Office of Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Promotion of Thailand, asserted the importance of enhancing the competitiveness and dynamism of SMEs by facilitating their access to information, market, human resources development and skills, finance and technology. </p> <p>Syed Nabil Fauwaz Aljeffri, secretary-general of the Asean-Business Advisory Council, called for public and private sector collaboration to reduce non-tariff barriers/measures (NTBs/ NTMs) to spur trade in the region. </p> <p>He raised the challenges faced by SMEs, including limited access to finance, market, technology, and facilitating free movement of goods. </p> <p>He said the Asean Business Advisory Council was studying ways to lower NTBs/NTMs and optimise the use of information and communication technology to support SMEs. </p> <p>The Asean SME Agencies Working Group (SMEWG), in coordination with the Asean Secretariat, is currently working on the Asean SME Service Centre Web Portal, which will provide information, business opportunities and advisory services to SMEs.</p> <p><strong>Sabah continues focus on SMEs</strong></p> <p>The Sabah state government has reiterated its focus on SMEs in the state through various initiatives to ensure they remain competitive.</p> <p>“This will be achieved through initiatives such as skills development, financial assistance, brand development, skills and entrepreneurship training and by providing infrastructure, institutional support and supervision.</p> <p>“This is to strengthen the SME sector so that all SMEs in the state can become competitive and developed,” Chief Minister Datuk Musa Aman said in a speech delivered by his Deputy Chief Minister, cum Minister of Industrial Development, Datuk Raymond Tan at the recent launch of the TM SME Bizfest 2015 there.</p> <p>Tan said it was important to maximise ICT usage through apps and skills to help businesses improve further.</p> <p>“The SME is an important sector for the country’s economy and to achieve the goal of a developed country by 2020. Last year the state’s SME sector recorded an encouraging growth of 65% in a five-year period with 40,000 SMEs being operational,” said Tan.</p> <p><strong>SME BANK target 90% Islamic financing</strong></p> <p>Small Medium Enterprise Development Bank Malaysia Bhd (SME Bank) is getting closer to reaching its target of turning into a full-fledged shariah development finance institution (DFI) with its Islamic financing portfolio now standing at 86.5%, amounting to RM4.31bil.</p> <p>The target is to achieve 90% Islamic financing portfolio by December 2015. When SME Bank was set up in October 2005, the Islamic financing portfolio was only 15%.</p> <p>Group managing director, Datuk Mohd Radzif Mohd Yunus, said the bank took a comprehensive approach in planning and executing the transformation.</p> <p>“The key focus areas include ensuring the staff are given sufficient exposure to gain the necessary skills and experience in managing the bank’s Islamic finance portfolio,” he said.</p> <p>Mohd Radzif said convincing customers to switch to Islamic financing was not a major challenge as Islamic finance provided the assurance of fairness for all, and transactions were based on genuine business activity or asset. And it prohibited any speculative practices.</p> <p>“Continuous engagement was done in addition to offering loyal customers no moving cost, unchanged monthly payments, as well as unchanged terms. These efforts have translated into high percentage of conversion that the bank has recorded,” he said.</p>\n",

      "<p>WE refer to the letter titled “Bank officers need to make field trips to know farming” (<em>The Star</em>, March 28). </p> <p>The reference made on “the sorry state of the dairy farms is due directly to financial institutions like Agrobank” is baseless and unfounded. The writer made several allegations against the Bank without proof and we strongly refute his claims.</p> <p>As a Development Financial Institution (DFI) with the mandate to develop the agriculture sector, Agrobank’s financing is driven by policies set by the Government. The dairy industry is relatively small, contributing about RM158.7mil or only 1.13% of total ex-farm value of the entire livestock sector in Malaysia. (Source: Livestock Statistics 2012/2013, Department of Veterinary Services Malaysia) </p> <p>There are many reasons contributing to the condition of dairy farms and to claim that Agrobank is directly responsible is both misleading and with bad intent.</p> <p>Agrobank is committed to ensuring that our officers are well equipped with the relevant skills and knowledge required to assess agriculture projects effectively.</p> <p>As part of our development programmes, Agrobank has been focusing on training in the agriculture sector and has also collaborated with other strategic partners such as UPM, Mardi, Department of Fisheries (DoF), Department of Veterinary Services (DVS) and Department of Agriculture (DoA) on specialised training. In addition, it has been a mandatory requirement for our officers to attend agricultural training as part of their KPIs. </p> <p>Site visits are an integral part of the financing origination process. In order to evaluate any financing application for agriculture projects, field trips are made by our officers during the financing initiation stage, and prior to each drawdown. Therefore, allegations that our officers do not conduct field visits are unfounded.</p> <p>Agrobank understands the importance of financing to entrepreneurs and henceforth we treat each application based on its own merit. There are many reasons why financing applications are rejected, including credit worthiness, project viability, lack of succession planning and also incomplete documentation. We believe the allegation on our officers on loan/financing rejection is contentious.</p> <p>For more than 46 years, Agrobank has provided support and financing for thousands of successful entrepreneurs in the agriculture sector. We remain committed to support the nation’s agenda in promoting and developing a strong agriculture industry in Malaysia.</p> <p><strong>AINUL ROFIDZA IBRAHIM</strong></p> <p><strong>Head, Corporate Communications Department,</strong></p> <p><strong>Agrobank</strong> </p>\n",

      "<p><strong>Managing your money as a couple takes mutual trust and shared goals.</strong></p><p>WHEN it comes to money matters, newly-weds software project manager Choong Jern Khang and test engineer Soo Phik Joo are certainly not starry-eyed.</p><p>From the beginning, they understood that marriage is also a financial union. They have discussed their priorities and goals, and are both on the same page.</p><p>For starters, the couple have agreed to delay starting a family till they are more financially stable. At 27, they both want to focus on their careers.</p><p>“Having children is not our top priority now. We are hoping to travel more and be financially stable before settling down to family life,” said Choong.</p><p>Like Choong and Soo, newly-weds IT consultant Sunnil Mohanadas, 32, and biomedical science graduate Hema Priya, 28, are also not in a hurry to have children.</p><p>“Children would be our priority later in life. Right now, we just want to spend time with each other to catch up on all the time we have lost,” said Hema who was in a long distance relationship with Sunnil for two years before tying the knot in November last year.</p><p>When they tied the knot, Choong and Soo had to make the transition from planning their finances individually to doing it as a couple.</p><p>“We need mutual trust and agreement when it comes to planning and discussing our finances together. We also have to be open and honest about our finances and not keep any secrets,” says Choong.</p><p>Financial experts recommend that newly-wed couples sit down and discuss their finances, including disclosing each other’s financial commitments and debts.</p><p>“It is a good thing that we are financially compatible. We agree on our ideas and plans for our future and share similar financial management styles,” adds Choong.</p><p>Sunnil and Hema say they are working on their financial compatibility, but it is not a huge issue in their relationship.</p><p>“Hema likes shopping more than me, but it doesn’t really bother me as long as she knows how to save.</p><p></p><hr/><p>Compare and apply for the best savings accounts with the highest interest rates in Malaysia.

So, Hema and I would discuss and set up a budget for the big expenses, but not the small expenses,” shares Sunnil.</p><p>Both couples are also fortunate because they share similar values with their partners on money.</p><p>They believe in spending prudently, saving for a rainy day and investing wisely.</p><p>Choong and Soo use a 60:40 formula in managing their money — 60% on needs and 40% on savings and entertainment.</p><p>“We spend 60% of our income on fixed commitments like house and car loans and living costs, and the other 40% on entertainment and savings,” says Choong who stresses that it takes discipline to save.</p><p></p><div class=\"embeded-image inline-image-center\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2849\" height=\"940\" src=\"https://cdn.star2.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/B877F386AC654235AF9A810324C0A4CD.jpg\" width=\"627\"/><div align=\"alignnone\" class=\"inline-caption\" id=\"attachment_2849\" width=\"627\"> Newlyweds Sunnil and Hema are making a change in their spending.</div></div><p>Sunnil is so determined to save that he put half his salary into a separate account.

We spend when we travel, and even then do not spend on extravagant hotels,” says Sunnil.</p><p>With GST kicking in this April, both couples are prepared to make the necessary cuts in their spending.</p><p>Choong and Soo say they’d probably cut down on entertainment, and Sunnil and Hema add they will eat out less.</p><p>Choong and Soo are not wasting their youth; they think it’s not too early to start getting on the right financial track and setting their goals together.</p><p>So, apart from their day jobs, Choong and Soo have also taken on part time work to earn more. Choong tutors students in the evenings, and Soo teaches Mandarin and piano.</p><p>They are working hard, says Choong, because they are not merely aiming for financial stability. They want to attain financial freedom by their 40s.</p><p>“We hope to achieve financial stability as soon as possible and financial freedom by the time we are 40 years old.</p><p>“We use the S.M.A.R.T. approach — our goals are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-specific ,” says Choong.</p><p>The couple is also hoping to start a small business one day and invest in properties to achieve their goal of financial freedom.</p><p></p><hr/><p>Fast business loans for SME, micro companies and startups from commerical banks and Malaysian DFI.

The ICP Programme has a sub-limit of RM1bil.</p> <p>“The ratings of the proposed Sukuk reflect the credit strength of Bank Rakyat, given its obligations under the purchase undertaking.</p> <p>“Concurrently, we have reaffirmed Bank Rakyat’s AA2/Stable/P1 financial institution ratings, along with the AA2(s)/Stable/- rating of its RM1bil IMTN programme issued by Imtiaz Sukuk Bhd, another funding conduit of Bank Rakyat,” it said.</p> <p>Bank Rakyat is a leading cooperative and developmental financial institution (DFI), with a strong foothold in the provision of personal-financing facilities to civil servants.</p> <p>It has an estimated 36% of the Malaysian personal-financing market. Given its status as a cooperative bank-cum-DFI and its large base of individual shareholders, it expects Bank Rakyat to derive government support if necessary. </p> <p>RAM Ratings said Bank Rakyat’s overall asset quality is deemed sound. The gross impaired-financing (GIF) ratio of the bank’s personal-financing portfolio which stood at 1.0% as at end-June 2013, was supported by its ability to access Biro Perkhidmatan Angkasa’s direct-salary-deduction system. </p> <p>Bank Rakyat’s credit-cost ratio remained relatively high, constrained by its weaker non-personal-financing portfolio and tighter provisioning policy for unsecured financing.</p> <p>As at the end of the first half June 30, 2013, the bank’s credit-cost ratio increased to an annualised 1.6% (end-FY December 2012: 0.9%). </p> <p>“However, we understand that this is in line with the management’s plan to build up the Bank’s GIF coverage ratio. As at end-June 2013, the ratio had risen to 130.2% (end-December 2012: 106.4%),” it pointed out. </p> <p>RAM Ratings said following Bank Negara Malaysia’s recent measures to curb household debt (which included a 10-year cap on the tenure of personal-financing), the bank has further tightened its underwriting criteria. </p> <p>This move is expected to moderate Bank Rakyat’s financing growth. In the first half ended June 30, 2013, the bank’s financing growth slowed to 6% (annualised) compared to 12% in FY December 2012.</p> <p>Bank Rakyat’s deposit base largely originates from government/statutory bodies and corporates, which brings about a relatively high level of depositor-concentration risk. </p> <p>Its top 10 depositors accounted for 25.0% of its deposits as at end-June 2013. However, the risk is moderated by the bank’s established relationships with these entities.</p>\n",

The former university lecturer set up DFI with some help from Japanese entrepreneur Tasunobu Abe.</p> <p> Before setting up DFI, Ibrahim, who has a master’s in food technology, worked for six years with <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=KFIMA\" target=\"_blank\">KUMPULAN FIMA BHD</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=KFIMA\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a>, where he set up the food technology department.</p> <p> </p> <div class=\"embeded-image\"> <img alt=\"Brahim's Nasi lemak with Sambal Ikan Bilis is one of the best sellers.\" src=\"http://www.thestar.com.my/~/media/00DCA949B51F451993D3212A472B9C78.ashx\" style=\"width: 460px; height: 692px;\"/> <div class=\"inline-caption\">Popular: Brahim’s Nasi Lemak with Sambal Ikan Bilis is one of the brand’s best sellers.</div> </div> <p> Ibrahim left Fima to start DFI after a proposal to adopt “retort pouch technology” was turned down. </p> <p> He felt the technology, which was developed in the US and Japan, was a good method for packaging food. </p> <p> When it began, DFI had paid-up capital of RM500,000, which was increased to RM1mil within a year. Another RM5.3mil was spent to build and equip a factory, as Ibrahim wanted DFI to be a leader in ready meals packed in retort pouches. </p> <p> After two years, Ibrahim introduced Brahim’s first two products to the market — beef and chicken rendang. This took the industry by storm, and in 1995, the company was listed on the KLSE before going private again in 2002.</p> <p> Nur Fatin joined DFI as an executive officer before being promoted to executive assistant to the executive chairman in 2006. In 2010, Nur Fatin was appointed group executive director while her father is now executive chairman of DFI and chairman of Dewina Holdings Sdn Bhd.</p> <p> “I watched the business grow and feel very connected to it. When I was young, I enjoyed watching how the food was processed. </p> <p> “Now, it is a different story as I have to make sure the business grows,” said Nur Fatin, the eldest of three siblings. </p> <p> Her younger sister is a medical doctor while brother, Ahmad Fahimi, is an executive officer with Brahim’s.</p> <p> </p> <p> <strong>Subsidiaries</strong></p> <p> Dewina Holdings Sdn Bhd is the investment holding and management company for DFI. It has also diversified into various other food service areas, including catering.</p> <p> The group currently serves more than 100,000 meals a day through its industrial catering businesses and employs more than 2,500 workers. </p> <p> </p><div class=\"embeded-image\">The other subsidiaries include Dewina Trading Sdn Bhd (the group’s marketing and distribution arm), Dewina Consult Sdn Bhd (set up in 2003 and led by Ibrahim and his wife, Datin Dr Hiryati Abdullah, a plant pathologist, Desasiswa Sdn Bhd (which manages Universiti Putra Malaysia’s food and beverage requirements) and Desatera, a joint venture between Dewina Holdings and the Armed Forces Cooperative set up in 1999, which operates 68 military cook-houses throughout Malaysia.<br/> </div> <p> Ibrahim is also the group executive chairman of Brahim’s Holdings Bhd, which was incorporated in 1982 as Tamadam Bonded Warehouse Bhd in 1982. It was changed to Brahim’s Holdings in June 2011.</p> <p> Currently, Brahim’s Holdings, which is the parent company of Brahim’s Airline Catering (formerly LSGB) and Dewina Host, operates in several segments including warehouse rental; freight forwarding and transportation; insurance; and food and beverage.  </p> <p> Brahim’s Airline Catering (BAC), formerly known as LSG Sky Chefs-<a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=BRAHIMS\" target=\"_blank\">Brahims</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=BRAHIMS\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a> Sdn Bhd (LSGB), is the principal in-flight services provider at both the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) and Penang International Airport. </p> <p> BAC currently serves 28 international airlines and is one of the main vendors for national carrier MAS.</p> <p> BAC caters to an average of 190 aircraft per day and prepares an average of 35,000 to 40,000 meals per day from its halal flight kitchen, which operates round-the-clock in KLIA. BAC is globally recognised for its halal-certified flight kitchen and its fully halal-compliant integrated food logistics supply chain. With 1,193 employees operating from a 59,000sq m complex in KLIA, BAC is the world’s biggest halal flight kitchen and has won many international awards for quality and excellence.</p> <p> Dewina Host Sdn Bhd, meanwhile, operates a portfolio of F&amp;B brands in KLIA and LCCT. They provide a mix of international brands and local favourites that cater to different travellers’ preferences. </p> <p> Café Barbera (SEA) Sdn Bhd, on the other hand, was a purely accidental venture. Ibrahim embarked on the franchise after a chance meeting with Enrico Barbera, the fifth generation Café Barbera owner in Bangkok several years ago. The first Barbera coffee shop was set up in 1870, in southern Italy by founder Domenico Barbera.</p> <p> Ibrahim holds the exclusive rights for cafe management, franchise and distribution in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. The first Café Barbera in Malaysia was set up in 2010 in Lorong Maarof, Bangsar, with another sub-franchise outlet in the KLIA departure hall. </p> <p> Currently, there are 39 Café Barbera outlets in the world, including four in Malaysia — Café Barbera Bangsar, Café Barbera KLIA, Café Barbera Sunway Pyramid and Café Barbera Subang Skypark.  </p> <p> Brahim’s extensive and dedicated R&amp;D team is always developing customer-driven products. The latest bestsellers are the MRE Rice range, launched in 2010 and include Nasi Goreng Kampung, Nasi Briyani Ayam, Nasi Briyani Kambing and the Nasi Lemak with Sambal Ikan Bilis.</p> <p> “We only use super-long Basmathi rice for the MRE fried rice range. It took us two years to develop the formula and get the right texture and taste. Our emphasis has always been premium food with healthy and good nutritional value. And, it has to be tasty!” Fatin said.</p> <p> </p> <p> <strong>New offerings</strong></p> <p> The seven types of fried rice offerings and ready meals have made Brahim’s the largest single manufacturer of the products in the country and the brand’s impact goes beyond just ringgit and sen. </p> <p> This year, Brahim’s expects to double the number of offerings and add variety to the fried rice meals that they are developing. </p> <p> Then there’s the extensive range of local sauces from <em>percik </em>to green Thai sauce and sweet and sour sauce. The ingredients added to the sauces, which include coconut milk, chillies, onions and tamarind juice, have had the same effect as the ready meals, leading to a boom in sales. </p> <p> “The sauces have given Brahim’s customers some alternatives to our popular ready meals. But our most popular MRE has to be the rendang. It has been getting more popular in this region and other parts of the world especially in the UK. We hope to be the leading ready meal provider of Asian food in the world,” said Nur Fatin, who is confident Brahim’s revenue will grow by 10% this year.</p> <p> “Brahim’s ready meals changed the way people think of our brand. It tells people that we are serious about offering nutritional and healthy food,” said Fatin.</p> <p> Having carved a name in the food industry locally and overseas spells big success for Brahim’s.</p> <p> “Customer feedback is important to us. When they sing our praises, it is music to our ears. So we try to develop more varieties of food and improve flavours to cater to them. Ready meal consumption has been steadily growing over the past 10 to 15 years and this is exactly what the industry needs,” said Nur Fatin.</p> <p> Brahim’s products have found a considerable following, but Nur Fatin admits there are limits to what her team can do. </p> <p> “There has to be willingness from consumers to buy our products. We only sell what people want to buy. For instance, we do not want to sell something that people may have readily available. That’s why we are cautious when introducing new products. Our R&amp;D team took two years just to get the right texture and flavour for the <em>nasi lemak</em> and <em>sambal ikan bilis</em> package. We have a huge market to please so we have got to make sure we get it right because failure would be damaging,” said Nur Fatin.</p> <p> Healthier fare does not come cheap for Brahim’s or its customers. Vegetables and meat are much more expensive and complicated to handle and store. Unlike its sauces, which have a shelf life of two years, the nasi goreng packs have a shelf life of 18 months. Preservatives are a big issue and Nur Fatin’s parents have made it clear that Brahim’s does not use artificial preservatives as part of its corporate social responsibility.</p> <p> “So, despite the fragility of the coconut milk and anchovies, we do not use any artificial preservatives or additives to keep them fresh longer. We try to retain the real flavour of the creamy nasi lemak and the chilli zing of the sambal, which is packaged separately,” said Nur Fatin. </p> <p> Overseas demand has been encouraging over the years especially in the UK, the US, Australia, Japan, Europe and Canada.</p> <p> “We introduced our Meals Ready to Eat Rice in 2010 and have been trying to penetrate the overseas market ever since. We have exported Brahim’s to Japan and decided to make our products more readily available there, so we have incorporated a distribution company called Brahim’s Food Japan,” she said.</p> <p> “Brahim’s is diversified in many ways. We started as a food manufacturer and now catering is our biggest contributor to the group. We have also have gone into manufacturing overseas, like in Jordan,” she said.</p>\n",

      "<p>PETALING JAYA: Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd is said to be revisiting the idea of a merger, this time with a development financial institution (DFI), sources said.</p> <p> Among the possible candidates are Bank Rakyat Malaysia Bhd and Malaysian Industrial Development Finance Bhd (MIDF), the sources added. </p> <p> Bank Muamalat and Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd – the latter owned by Lembaga Tabung Haji – are the only two standalone Islamic banks in the country licensed by Bank Negara. </p> <p> DFIs, meanwhile, are specialised financial institutions established by the Government with the specific mandate to develop and promote key sectors that are considered of strategic importance. </p> <p> DFIs include Bank Simpanan Nasional, Export-Import Bank of Malaysia Bhd, Small Medium Enterprise Development Bank Malaysia Bhd or SME Bank and Bank Pembangunan Malaysia Bhd as well as Bank Rakyat and MIDF.</p> <p> To recap, the shareholders of Bank Muamalat had been in negotiations with <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=AFFIN\" target=\"_blank\">AFFIN HOLDINGS BHD</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=AFFIN\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a> on a potential acquisition, but talks between the two were called off at end-March.</p> <p> It was reported that Affin had sought to acquire a portion of <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=DRBHCOM\" target=\"_blank\">DRB-HICOM BHD</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=DRBHCOM\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a>’s 70% stake in Bank Muamalat, but the deal fell through due to pricing issues. Talks between the parties had commenced in August last year. At that time, Affin had said it expected to conclude the discussions by the end of 2012. </p> <p> <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=DRBHICOM\" target=\"_blank\">DRB-HICOM</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=DRBHICOM\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a>, whose interests vary from ports to property development, had acquired the 70% block in Bank Muamalat in 2008 on the condition that it eventually reduced this to 40%.</p> <p> It is learnt that Affin was looking to buy 30% of Bank Muamalat from DRB-Hicom.</p> <p> Khazanah Nasional Bhd owns the remaining 30% of Bank Muamalat.</p> <p> Affin’s withdrawal from the talks was seen as putting DRB-Hicom in a tight spot, given that it has to pare down its stake in accordance with Bank Negara regulations.</p> <p> Industry players say the idea of a merger between Bank Muamalat and Bank Rakyat is an attractive proposition as both are Islamic concerns, with Bank Rakyat being the country’s largest Islamic cooperative bank.</p> <p> Bank Rakyat, according to sources, is believed to have ambitions to grow its commercial banking segment and a clear path to this would be via a merger with an Islamic bank.</p> <p> Industry observers have also noted that it was always the aspiration of the central bank to create a mega Malaysian Islamic bank, which would cement the country’s status as the world’s largest sukuk market and a hub for Islamic finance.</p> <p> Bank Muamalat has had a tough time courting suitors over the past few years, having failed to strike a merger deal with Bank Islam Malaysia in 2011 and Bahrain-based Islamic lender Al Baraka Banking Group prior to that.</p> <p> Still, Bank Muamalat has worked to clean up its books and improve its returns over the past few years.</p> <p> For the financial year (FY) ended March 31, 2013, Bank Muamalat posted a record pre-tax profit of RM236mil, with revenue rising close to 12% to nearly RM1bil. Its asset size stood at RM21.07bil.</p> <p> The bank began operations in October 1999, with its combined assets and liabilities being brought over from the Islamic banking windows of the-then Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd, Bank of Commerce (M) Bhd and BBMB Kewangan Bhd.</p> <p> Bank Rakyat, meanwhile, has been enjoying profitable growth over the years, breaching the RM1bil profitability mark in 2008. For FY2011, it made a profit before tax and zakat of RM2.02bil, with the bulk of its financing income coming from consumer banking. </p> <p> During the three months to March 31, it posted profit before tax and zakat of RM539.52mil. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>\n",

Personal financing today has evolved somewhat. It is no longer an unnecessary product to encourage indebtedness,” noted Clifford.</p><p>He said personal financing is presently also utilised to reduce credit card differential repayments that could be leveraged upon with the former's lower rates.</p><p>He said the facility was also used by many of its customers to pay for their children's education, or parents' hospitalisation fees.</p><p>MBSB said its outlook this year was “going strong”, leveraging on the strength of the overall consumer market.</p><p>“You can see a lot of housing projects being launched. Businesses also do not seem to be slowing down much  even if there were a slowdown, it is only a small percentage,” senior vice-president for retail business division Azman Aziz added.</p>\n",

      "<p>BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq's parliament is chasing about $17 billion of Iraqi oil money it says was stolen after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and has asked the United Nations for help to track it down.</p><p>The missing money was shipped to Iraq from the United States to help with reconstruction after the ouster of Saddam Hussein.</p><p>In a letter to the U.N. office in Baghdad last month, parliament's Integrity Committee asked for help to find and recover the oil money taken from the Development Fund of Iraq (DFI) in 2004 and lost in the chaos that followed the invasion.</p><p>\"All indications are that the institutions of the United States of America committed financial corruption by stealing the money of the Iraqi people, which was allocated to develop Iraq, (and) that it was about $17 billion,\" said the letter sent to the U.N. with a 50-page report.</p><p>The committee called the disappearance of the money a \"financial crime\" but said U.N. Security Council resolutions prevent Iraq from making a claim against the United States.</p><p>\"Our committee decided to send this issue to you ... to look into it and restore the stolen money,\" said the letter, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters.</p><p>U.N. officials were not immediately available for comment.</p><p>SALARIES, PENSIONS</p><p>The DFI was established in 2003 at the request of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), the U.S. body headed by Paul Bremer that governed Iraq after the invasion. The fund was to be used to pay the salaries and pensions of Iraqi government workers and for reconstruction projects.</p><p>In 2004, the administration of former U.S. President George W. Bush flew billions of dollars in cash into Iraq. The money came from the sale of Iraqi oil, surplus funds from the U.N. oil-for-food programme and seized Iraqi assets.</p><p>Last July, an audit report from the U.S. Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) said the U.S. Department of Defence was unable to account properly for $8.7 billion of Iraqi oil and gas money after the 2003 invasion.</p><p>Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh told Al Jazeera television on Sunday: \"No one on the Iraqi side was controlling the work of Paul Bremer at that time. So I think the administration of the United States needs to give the answers for where and how this (money) was being used.</p><p>\"We do understand that Iraqis are also engaged in such lack of transparency and corruption related to the Paul Bremer time in Iraq,\" he added.</p><p>Osama al-Nujaifi, Iraq's parliament speaker, said a committee was investigating what happened to some $20 billion of DFI money.</p><p>\"Some of these funds were spent and are documented. But some do not have such documents,\" he said. \"We as a parliament are working together with the Iraqi Board of Supreme Audits and with coordination of SIGIR to know where this money ended up.\"</p><p>The appeal to the United Nations could help Iraq recover its money by putting its case before the international community, said Bahaa al-Araji, the head of the Integrity Committee.</p><p>\"We cannot sue the Americans. Laws do not allow us to do that. All we want is to get this issue to the U.N.,\" Araji said. \"If this works, it will open the way for Iraq to restore its stolen money.\"</p><p>In 2003, the CPA issued an order granting immunity to U.S. personnel and institutions working in Iraq.</p><p>(Editing by Jim Loney)</p>\n",

      "<p>BAGHDAD: A U.S. audit has found that the Pentagon cannot account for over 95 percent of US$9.1 billion in Iraq reconstruction money, spotlighting Iraqi complaints that there is little to show for the massive funds pumped into their cash-strapped, war-ravaged nation.</p><p>The $8.7 billion in question was Iraqi money managed by the Pentagon, not part of the $53 billion that Congress has allocated for rebuilding. It's cash that Iraq, which relies on volatile oil revenues to fuel its spending, can ill afford to lose.</p><p>\"Iraq should take legal action to get back this huge amount of money,\" said Sabah al-Saedi, chairman of the Parliamentary Integrity Committee. The money \"should be spent for rebuilding the country and providing services for this poor nation.\"</p><p>The report by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction accused the Defense Department of lax oversight and weak controls, though not fraud.</p><p>\"The breakdown in controls left the funds vulnerable to inappropriate uses and undetected loss,\" the audit said.</p><p>The Pentagon has repeatedly come under fire for apparent mismanagement of the reconstruction effort — as have Iraqi officials themselves.</p><p>Seven years after the U.S.-led invasion, electricity service is spotty, with generation capacity falling far short of demand. Fuel shortages are common and unemployment remains high, a testament to the country's inability to create new jobs or attract foreign investors.</p><p>Complaints surfaced from the start of the war in 2003, when soldiers failed to secure banks, armories and other facilities against looters. Since then the allegations have only multiplied, including investigations of fraud, awarding of contracts without the required government bidding process and allowing contractors to charge exorbitant fees with little oversight, or oversight that came too late.</p><p>But the latest report comes at a particularly critical time for Iraq. Four months after inconclusive elections, a new government has yet to be formed, raising fears that insurgents will tap into the political vacuum to stir sectarian unrest.</p><p>In a sign that insurgents are still intent on igniting sectarian violence, at least six people were killed and dozens more wounded when a female suicide bomber blew herself up near a checkpoint in the holy city of Karbala, local police said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.</p><p>Thousands of Shiite pilgrims are converging on the city, 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Baghdad, for an important religious holiday marking the birth of a Shiite saint known as the \"Hidden Imam\" who disappeared in the ninth century. Such mass displays of devotion by Shiites have often been targeted by Sunni extremists.</p><p>Iraqi lawmakers met Tuesday, but for the second time this month failed to convene a parliament session, leaving wide open the question of when the new government will take shape.</p><p>Underscoring its financial challenges, the International Monetary Fund in March approved a $3.6 billion loan to help Iraq meet its obligations. Iraq is projected to run a deficit through 2011, according to analysts, with a possibility of a surplus following that hinging on oil prices.</p><p>Iraq took a financial hit in 2008 as oil prices plummeted on the back of the global financial meltdown. While those prices have since rebounded, Iraq remains at the mercy of international oil markets, with revenues from petroleum sales accounting for over 90 percent of its government budget.</p><p>The $9.1 billion in question came from the Development Fund for Iraq, which was set up by the U.N. Security Council in 2003. The DFI includes revenues from Iraq's oil and gas exports, as well as frozen Iraqi assets and surplus funds from the defunct, Saddam Hussein-era U.N. oil-for-food program.</p><p>Iraq had given the U.S. authorization to tap into the fund, which is held in New York, for humanitarian and reconstruction efforts, withdrawing that approval in December 2007.</p><p>With the establishment of the Coalition Provisional Authority, which ran Iraq shortly after the start of the U.S. invasion in 2003 until mid-2004, about $20 billion was placed into the account. The $9.1 billion audited by the Iraq reconstruction inspector general were funds withdrawn from that account between 2004 and 2007.</p><p>The report found that the Defense Department could not \"readily account for its obligations, expenditures and remaining balances associated\" with the DFI. At issue was $8.7 billion, or 95 percent of the withdrawn funds.</p><p>Of this amount, the Pentagon could not account at all for $2.6 billion, according to the audit.</p><p>Tracing the rest of the money is difficult because of a combination of lax financial controls and management, the failure to designate an organization to oversee the spending and the failure to set up and deposit the funds in special accounts, as required by the Treasury Department.</p><p>The Defense Department, in responses attached to the audit, said it agreed with the report's recommendations to establish better guidelines for monitoring such funds, including appointing an oversight organization mostly likely by November.</p><p>The failure to properly manage billions in reconstruction funds has also hobbled the troubled U.S.-led effort to rebuild Afghanistan. About $60 billion have poured into Afghanistan since 2001 in hopes of bringing electricity, clean water, jobs, roads and education to the crippled country.</p><p>The U.S. alone has committed $51 billion to the project since 2001, and plans to raise the stakes to $71 billion over the next year — more than it has spent on reconstruction in Iraq since 2003.</p><p>An Associated Press investigation showed that the results so far — or lack of them — threaten to do more harm than good. The number of Afghans with access to electricity has increased from 6 percent in 2001 to only about 10 percent now, far short of the goal of providing power to 65 percent of urban and 25 percent of rural households by the end of this year.</p><p>As an example of the problems, a $100 million diesel-fueled power plant was built with the goal of delivering electricity to more than 500,000 residents of the capital, Kabul. The plant's costs tripled to $305 million as construction lagged a year behind schedule. The plant now often sits idle because the Afghans were able to import cheaper power from neighboring Uzbekistan before the plant came online. - AP</p><p>Latest business news from AP-Wire</p>\n",

      "<div align=\"RIGHT\"></div><b>By Sue Pleming</b><p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge ruled on Monday that a whistle-blower case alleging fraud against a U.S. security contractor employed in Iraq could go ahead, but excluded any work paid for with Iraqi oil money. </p><p>In what is seen as a test case for U.S. companies working in Iraq, the judge left open a key question over the legal status of the U.S.-led occupation authority that paid the contractor and whether it was subject to U.S. law. </p><p>The case involves Custer Battles, an upstart security firm based in Rhode Island that had a contract with the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority in 2003 to guard Baghdad Airport and a later logistical deal. </p><p>Former associates of the company sued under the False Claims Act that it defrauded the U.S. government of millions,  a claim Custer Battles strongly denies. </p><p>In issuing his opinion, Judge T.S.

      "<div align=\"RIGHT\"></div><b>By Sue Pleming</b><p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge ruled on Monday that a whistle-blower case alleging fraud against a U.S. security contractor employed in Iraq could go ahead, but excluded any work paid for with Iraqi oil money. </p><p>In what is seen as a test case for U.S. companies working in Iraq, the judge left open a key question over the legal status of the U.S.-led occupation authority that paid the contractor and whether it was subject to U.S. law. </p><p>The case involves Custer Battles, an upstart security firm based in Rhode Island that had a contract with the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority in 2003 to guard Baghdad Airport and a later logistical deal. </p><p>Former associates of the company sued under the False Claims Act that it defrauded the U.S. government of millions,  a claim Custer Battles strongly denies. </p><p>In issuing his opinion, Judge T.S.

      "<div align=\"RIGHT\"></div><b>By Evelyn Leopold</b><p>UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.N. Security Council members on Monday expressed concern that Iraq was not paying suppliers of goods it ordered under the oil-for-food program before it closed down. </p><p>The United Nations turned over most of the program's money to an Iraqi fund to cover contracts for vehicles, water, oil spare parts and other goods that the new Iraq leaders wanted on a priority basis. </p><p>These contracts had been signed before the $67 billion program closed down, several months after the U.S.-led invasion in March 2003. </p><p>But participants at council consultations said that Iraq had not paid many of the suppliers, some of whom had delivered goods. Others sent partial supplies after having received a downpayment. </p><p>The exact amount outstanding was not known but France's U.N. ambassador, Jean-Marc de la Sabliere said French firms alone were owed about $90 million for 40 contracts. Companies from Belgium, Jordan, Tunisia, Algeria and others were also on the list of several hundred outstanding contracts. </p><p>\"The secretariat said that they are looking at it. It's a legal and technical issue,\" said de la Sabliere, this month's council president. </p><p>The latest discrepancy was revealed to council members in a closed meeting by Jean-Pierre Halbwachs, the U.N. controller and head of the International Advisory and Monitoring Board, set up to audit the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI). The fund, into which oil revenues are deposited, serves in effect as Iraq's budget. </p><p>Halbwachs also briefed members on the board's third audit of the fund, released at the end of May. The audit was conducted by the KPMG accounting firm to cover the period from June 29 to the end of 2004. This showed Iraq could not account for 618,000 tonnes of fuel oil worth $69 million, failed to install equipment to meter oil production and granted many contracts on a noncompetitive basis without explanation. </p><p>In addition, the State Oil Marketing Organization improperly deposited $97.8 million of oil proceeds into three unauthorized bank accounts in Iraq and Jordan and carried out $461 million in barter transactions, which were discouraged by the board because they are hard to track, KPMG said. </p><p>De la Sabliere said that while Iraq's accounting of the monies was insufficient, \"I think that all members of the council have acknowledged the efforts of the Iraqi government to improve the situation.\" </p><p>The fund has been plagued with mismanagement from the start, including during the time it was run by the United States and Britain after the invasion. </p><p></p><p></p><p>\n",

      "<div align=\"RIGHT\"></div><b><b>By Yeow Pooi Ling</b></b><p>MALAYSIAN Industrial Development Finance Bhd’s (MIDF) share price is not reflective of its position as an investment-banking group, said analysts.  </p><p> “The stock has largely been overlooked by investors despite its undemanding valuation and improving fundamentals,” Mayban Securities said in a research note.  </p><p> The research house said it expected the group to dispose of non-core assets. The MIDF group comprises 44 companies, of which half are dormant.  </p><p> Its four core businesses are investment banking, asset management, development finance and property. </p><p> Mayban said given its prospects compared with other investment banks, the stock was trading at “unreasonably cheap valuation” at price-to-book value (P/BV) of 0.67 time and price-to-earnings ratio of 6.8 times for the financial year ending December 2005. </p><p></p><table align=\"left\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"7\" width=\"190\"> <tr><td> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/50494844-2B62-4835-BDFB-7869973F1732\"/> </td></tr></table><p> This was lower than the multiples of all the commercial banks, which were trading at P/BV of between 0.7 time and 2.7 times, it added.  </p><p> In addition, MIDF’s status as a development financial institution (DFI) might be misconstrued by investors who perceived the company as being largely a government-linked institution to help the manufacturing sector financially rather than being seriously taken as a profit-driven entity, the research house said.  </p><p> Over the last two years, MIDF had completed the acquisition of Amanah Capital Partners (March 2003) and Utama Merchant Bank (December 2004).  </p><p> It has also proposed to buy the remaining 14.9% stake in United Merchant Bank Bhd it does not own from HSBC Bank Malaysia Bhd for RM29.7mil, which is likely to be completed by the second quarter this year.  </p><p> This will lead to the group consolidating and taking full control of the merchant bank and pave the way for a foreign partner, which is allowed to take up to 49% under Bank Negara’s investment bank (IB) framework. </p><p> Under the framework, MIDF qualifies for a full-fledged IB status once it merges its merchant bank, stockbroking arm and discount houses. The company engaged a consulting firm in January to advise on the structure.  </p><p> The research house said it expected MIDF’s operating profit this year to grow 8%, driven by its investment banking operations as well as the asset management division. </p><p> For the financial year ended December 2004, the group posted pre-tax profit of RM300.8mil on the back of RM624.1mil sales. Operating profit for the year was RM197.7mil.  </p><p></p><table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"7\" width=\"378\"> <tr><td> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/495D9BC1-63C0-4FE8-84A4-A85A4AD7B3F7\"/> </td></tr></table><p> The investment banking division also houses Amanah Butler Malaysia Sdn Bhd, the largest money broking firm in the country. MIDF presently controls 30% market share of the local money and foreign exchange broking, according to Mayban. </p><p> United Merchant, which reported losses last year, was likely to turn around this year although not significantly, it said, adding that it estimated MIDF’s return on equity of 12.5% in 2005 and 13.1% in 2006.  </p><p> Nevertheless, Mayban said it was concerned on how effectively the group would be in reducing bad loans at United Merchant level and lowering its non-performing loans (NPL).  </p><p> Its net NPL ratio has risen to 20% from 9.5% based on a three-month classification since the completion of the acquisition. “These will be crucial factors in determining the group’s performance going forward,” it said.  </p><p> Avenue Securities banking analyst Chan Keng Yew said competition was likely to be stiffer with the imminent entry of foreign brokers into the capital market.  </p><p> “The pie may have grown bigger but there is a lot of competition,” he said, adding that MIDF had to increase its prudence and efficiency. </p><p> <b>MIDF</b> :  [<a href=\"http://biz.thestar.com.my/marketwatch/s.asp?c=5525\" target=\"_blank\">Stock Watch</a>]  [<a href=\"http://biz.thestar.com.my/marketwatch/news.asp?qs=5525&amp;newsearch=true\" target=\"_blank\">News</a>]</p><p></p><p>\n",

      "<b></b><p><b>Amid the interest in GLC revamps, it is easy to forget those that are not listed. Undercapitalised and burdened by bad loans, Bank Industri &amp; Teknologi Malaysia needs rejuvenation. The process has already begun, says Othman Mohd Rijal.</b> </p><p>AMID the expectation that a successful revamp of government-linked companies(GLCs) will boost the stock market,it is easy to forget that not all ofthese companies are listed. For thatmatter, some of them will never getto Bursa Malaysia simply becausemaking profits is not their raisond'être. </p><p>However, even for these companies, there is no escaping the mounting pressure to perform better. Bank Industri &amp; Teknologi Malaysia Bhd knows all about this. It celebrated its 25th anniversary last month, but this year is meaningful not just because of the silverjubilee. </p><p>Undercapitalised and burdened by the high-risk lending it is called upon to provide, Bank Industri is reshaping itself. The restructuring is expected to be completed by the year-end. </p><p>The idea is to become stronger in dealing with changes in the financial services business and in the strategic sectors that the bank focuses on. </p><p>Over the years, the bank's basic role has been the same – to give medium to long-term financing to strategic capital-intensive industries. What have changed significantly are the nature of these industries and the ability of the domestic capital market to finance their businesses. </p><p>Bank Industri chairman Tan Sri Othman Mohd Rijal says the bank must reposition itself to continue to be effective in its role as a development financial institution (DFI) thatsupports these strategic sectors. He points out that the bank has to keep up with rapid advances in high-technology industries so that it can continue to offer financialproducts that meet the demand of these industries. </p><p>In addition, DFIs are perhaps no longer the No.1 option when a high-risk business needs financing. Venture capital and debt securities have become reliable alternatives. </p><p>For Bank Industri, restructuring is a necessary response. Says chairman Tan Sri Othman Mohd Rijal, “We have to repair and clean our balance sheet, and address capitaladequacy issues. Of course, we next have to improve the bank’s organisational structure, processes and operations.” </p><p>The basis of the exercise is an ongoing review done jointly with professional service firm KPMG and Rating Agency Malaysia Bhd (RAM). A development that was instru-mental in pushing the bank towards some serious self-examination was the enactment of the Development Financial Institutions Act, which took effect in February 2002. </p><p>Following this, the bank and two main subsidiaries, Export-Import Bank of Malaysia Bhd (Exim Bank) and Malaysia Export CreditInsurance Bhd (Mecib), came under Bank Negara's supervision. Along with that came the inevitable comparison with other players in the banking sector. </p><p>At the same time, the government's push to reform GLCs, including the introduction of KPIs (key performance indicators), addsimpetus to Bank Industri's restructuring efforts. </p><p>“We welcome this initiative because it brings the management and direction of the business in line with what is stipulated in the act, which essentially emphasises goodmanagement, prudential risk management, and, of course, capital adequacy,” Othman explains. </p><p><b>The DFI difference</b> </p><p>When stacked up against, say, the country's commercial banks, Bank Industri looks very much like a poor cousin. The latter's risk-weighted capital ratio (RWCR) is -29% (a neg-ative ratio means that the capital base is insufficient to cover the assets, including loans) and its net non-performing loans (NPL) ratio as at June was 13.5%. </p><p>According to Bank Negara's July statistics, the commercial banks's RWCR and net NPL ratio stood at 14.2% and 5.8%. The overall banking system had a RWCR of 13.9% and anet NPL ratio of 6.2%. </p><p>However, because Bank Industri is a DFI, there is room to argue that it and commercial banks do not even belong to the same family. “In a way, we are a slightly different creature,” says Othman. </p><p>In a few ways, actually. To begin with, the bank was set up in 1979 to fill a gap in the financial system. Back then, commercial banks were reluctant – and understandably, still are – to take on the high risk thatcomes with lending to certain businesses in the maritime and manufacturing industries. </p><p>But these industries were deemed important to the nation's development goals, and thus DFIs like Bank Industri were required tofinance such businesses. Naturally, that has led to a loan portfolio that has a disproportionate amount of assets of lesser quality. </p><p>Says Othman, “If we were to apply prudence in the same way it is applied among commercial banks, we wouldn't be lending any-thing.” </p><p>Another key difference is that Bank Industri was left out in the restructuring of the banking sector in the wake of the Asian financial crisis. For example, it did notreceive capital injection from Danamodal Nasional Bhd. But it is clear that there is a need to address the bank's weak RWCR. </p><p>Indeed, the bank has sought fresh capital from the government – Minister of Finance (Inc) owns Bank Industri – and at one time, had apparently fancied its chances of getting a positive response. In a rating review published last March, RAM says it had been “given to understand” that the government had agreed to restore the RWCR toat least 8%. According to the rating agency, that would need a capital injection of about RM800mil. </p><p>“The government’s plan to recapitalise the bank is viewed positively by RAM, although we believe that it may take some time before the actual capital injection takes place,”says the report. </p><p>It will be a long wait. Bank Industri is now resigned to making do without recapitalisation by the government. Othman says the capital injection is not likely to happen because the government is now intent on balancing the budget. “I think we have to figure out ways how to repair the bank's capital structure ourselves.” </p><p><b>Floating to the top</b> </p><p>In that respect, it helps that Bank Industri has some useful investments on its books. Last December, for example, it unlocked substantial value when <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=MAYBULK\" target=\"_blank\">MALAYSIAN BULK CARRIERS BHD</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=MAYBULK\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a> (a joint venture with the Kuokgroup) was floated on Bursa Malaysia's main board. </p><p>Through subsidiary Global Maritime Ventures Bhd (GMV), Bank Industri still holds over 20% in the shipping company. “It's alreadylisted and we will harvest the proceeds from there,” says Othman. </p><p>In addition, the bank is banking on gaining from the possible flotation of another shipping business. According to GMV's 2003 annual report, it operated 12 vessels injoint venture with Wawasan Shipping Sdn Bhd, a unit of the IMC group, which is controlled by shipping magnate Tan Sri Frank Tsao. </p><p>The listing proposal is still in the planning stages, but Bank Industri hopes to reap almost RM1bil in cash flow when it eventually disposes of its shares in the two shipping companies. </p><p>“That should bring us to a positive RWCR of 14% to 18%, depending on how we package the deals. That's way above the minimum BankNegara requirement of 8%,” Othman says. “We consider ourselves very lucky because we have made very good investments that are maturing at the right time.” But he concedesthat the bank cannot depend on Lady Luck to bail it out the next time. </p><p>He says because of the kind of lending it does and the portfolio it carries, it may well be back to square one in a matter of a few years. He adds that the bank shouldbe compensated by other measures if a capital injection is not forthcoming. </p><p>The RWCR formula is a source of contention. The bank's group managing director, Datuk Md Noor Yusoff says the formula requires thebank's investment in subsidiaries to be taken out of the bank's capital base. </p><p>He argues, “We have to create so many subsidiaries. Given our small capital, we have to borrow from the market to increase it. The ratio is negative, but we still continue our operations like normal. And theinvestments in the subsidiaries are still good investments.” </p><p>Othman takes a somewhat different approach. He views it as a positive that Bank Industri is included in the authorities' moves to strengthen the country's banking systemand culture. At the same time, he feels that Bank Industri's responsibility for supporting high-risk ventures has to be taken into account. </p><p>“The standards as applied by Bank Negara relates to the business of lending and finance. You can't use a different measurement. A measurement is a measurement. That's it. You've got to accept that. </p><p>“But when the subject matter doesn't really fit (into the framework of standards), you have to look into what can be done to remedythat at policy and structural levels.”When asked if the bank has figured out the remedial measures, Othman says this is being done as part of the strategic review. </p><p>“Whether the government will accept it (the bank's proposal) or whether it has other approaches, I wouldn't know.” </p><p><b>Related story:</b><a href=\"http://biz.thestar.com.my/bizweek/story.asp?file=/2004/9/11/bizweek/8866780&amp;sec=bizweek\" target=\"on_top\">A major role in the country's development</a> </p><p></p><p></p><p>\n",

      "<p>WHEN Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin announced his stimulus package, it appeared, at first glance, a commendable, even an impressive, feat by his government to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, two key points merit assessment of the Perikatan Nasional government’s response to this crisis.</p> <p>First, when Muhyiddin addressed the nation, remarkably enough, he began by admitting that his “government may not be the government you voted for”.</p> <p>This was an astonishing admission by the Prime Minister, that he was aware many Malaysians question the legitimacy of his Perikatan government.</p> <p>The second point was his resolve to use government-linked companies (GLCs) to deal with the crisis. This, too, was an intriguing admission that he, as Prime Minister, had control of powerful business-related government-linked institutions that he could deploy during this crisis.</p> <p>Indeed, Finance Minister Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz would later draw reference to a “government ecosystem”. According to the Finance Minister, “direct fiscal injection” would come “from government agencies and related parties” in this ecosystem. Zafrul was not clear though of the source of borrowings by the government to fund this stimulus package.</p> <p>Muhyiddin’s admission of his control of major GLCs that have funds and other resources to support people and businesses in need was an indication of two core matters.</p> <p>First, Malaysia is a highly interventionist state with a well-developed institutional architecture to stimulate the economy and protect the interests of people in need.</p> <p>Second, a political-business nexus is in place in government, with the power that comes from such ties concentrated in the hands of the Prime Minister. This influential ecosystem, created in the 1970s to resolve social injustices, though now critiqued as a money-power nexus, has long remained in the shadows. In spite of repeated public demand for transparency about this “government ecosystem”, no prime minister has been willing to do so, even after the economic crises in 1997 and 2008.</p> <p>In this time of the Covid-19 crisis, there is a particular need to analyse how this powerful political-business nexus is being – or not being – employed in this stimulus package.</p> <p>What Muhyiddin and Zafrul referred to as GLCs, it must be stressed, includes much more than public-listed companies controlled by the government, such as the utilities-based Tenaga Nasional and Telecom and the financial-based Maybank, CIMB, RHB Bank and Bank Islam.</p> <p>This ecosystem includes pension and savings funds (such as</p> <p>EPF and PNB), statutory bodies (like Mara and Felda) and development financial institutions or DFIs (such</p> <p>as SME Bank, EXIM Bank</p> <p>and Agro Bank).</p> <p>The Prime Minister has stated, though with little clarity, how some of these GLCs will be employed.</p> <p>Tenaga Nasional, along with the government, according to Muhyiddin, will offer a discount on power consumption that will amount to RM530mil. Telecommunications firms will offer free Internet services with the government allocating RM600mil for this. Presumably, GLCs in these sectors will absorb these costs.</p> <p>As for the GLC banks, they will offer loan moratoriums, though this will not mean huge losses for them as these are merely deferred payments. EPF, though a pension fund, will allow for withdrawals to help people meet their expenses during this crisis.</p> <p>Most of these measures, as well as other aspects of the stimulus package, have already begun to draw much criticism.</p> <p>Why, for example, in this health-</p> <p>related crisis, have the GLC-based hospitals not been included in this stimulus package? GLC hospitals such as KPJ and Pantai as well as those controlled by Sime Darby were not mentioned, though Muhyiddin called on private hospitals to help the government. And, what of pharmaceuticals-based Pharmaniaga, as well as UEM-Edgenta which provide health-related services? Indeed, UEM-Edgenta has been criticised for not treating its workers well. During this pandemic, there is no need for these major health, financial and utilities-based GLCs to worry about registering huge profits.</p> <p>Other criticisms have emerged, particularly involving EPF.</p> <p>NGOs have admonished the government for calling on Malaysians, especially those in the B40, to use their meagre savings to share responsibility to reflate the economy. The SME Association has reacted badly to the stimulus package, claiming that 50% of such firms will wind down, with at least four million people losing their jobs. These SMEs constitute about 98% of the corporate sector.</p> <p>Since the Finance Minister has stated that the stimulus package will entail a reallocation of funds among government-linked agencies, other related issues arise.</p> <p>Why not reallocate funds in DFIs such as SME Bank, MIDF, Bank Pembangunan and EXIM Bank to small and micro firms which are in dire need to remain afloat?</p> <p>Why not employ Agro Bank and Bank Rakyat to help rural industries to ensure continued food production and supply? And what about statutory bodies such as Mara, Kesedar, Ketengah, Risda and Felcra, created to support small and rural industries?</p> <p>These institutions have, in fact, been long abused for patronage and distribution of concessions to obtain political support.</p> <p>Indeed, soon after the Perikatan government took power, it changed the board of directors of Mara which has oversight of a huge business base. There is a well-framed institutional architecture in this government ecosystem that has been used in the past to allow the government to intervene in the economy to achieve noble goals. These business-related government institutions can be employed to get help quickly to the ground during this crisis.</p> <p>There is, however, little indication in this stimulus package that the Prime Minister is using this government ecosystem effectively to deal with this pandemic.</p> <p>In fact, while trying to channel funds to people to increase consumption to sustain the economy, the government appears equally preoccupied with helping major GLCs remain profitable, keeping a powerful political-business nexus in place.After all, the Prime Minister himself admitted in his speech, he also has to deal with a political crisis.</p> <p>If ever there was a time to expose this powerful GLC world, and for politicians to dispense with using this power nexus to consolidate their position in government, it is now.</p> <p>Importantly too, since this shadow government’s ecosystem will be deployed to fuel the economy by an administration whose legitimacy is in question, it is imperative that parliament be convened to debate this stimulus package.</p> <p>Prof Terence Gomez specialises in political economy and is the dean of the Economics and Administration Faculty at Universiti Malaya.

      "<p>BANK Negara has issued a FAQ on the six-month loan repayment moratorium, which clarified that borrowers need not apply as the process is automatic.</p> <p>The central bank also clarified that the interest will continue to accrue during the deferment period. This could result in higher subsequent installment amount or an extension of the loan tenure. Below is the FAQ in full.</p> <p>Q: What is deferment of loan or financing repayment?</p> <p>It is a temporary deferment or suspension of loan/financing repayment obligation (principal and interest) for a limited period of time.</p> <p>During this period, borrowers/customers with loan/financing that meet the conditions do not need to make any repayment, and no late payment charges or penalties will be imposed.</p> <p>Interest/profit will continue to accrue on loan/financing repayments that are deferred and borrowers/customers will need to honour the deferred repayments in the future. Loan/financing repayment resumes after the deferment period.</p> <p>Q: What is the objective of the deferment package?</p> <p>The aim of this package is to provide some relief to individuals and businesses who face temporary financial constraints arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>We hope that this will help individuals and businesses facing financial adversities to cope with challenges during this period. Loan/financing repayment resumes after the deferment period.</p> <p>Q: Which loan/financing qualifies for the deferment?</p> <p>For individuals and small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the deferment in conventional loans or Islamic financing repayment obligations (except credit cards) are automatically effected by banks and development financial institutions (DFIs) if the loans/financing meet these criteria:</p> <p>&gt; not in arrears exceeding 90 days as at April 1,2020; and</p> <p>&gt; denominated in ringgit.</p> <p>Meanwhile, corporate borrowers/customers may request for a moratorium on loan/financing repayment from their respective banks.</p> <p>Q: Can I ask for more than six months deferment?</p> <p>The deferment is only for six months. Please contact the bank if you require a longer deferment period.</p> <p>Q: If I opt for the deferment, will my CCRIS records be adversely affected?</p> <p>No. However, interest/profit will continue to accrue on loan/financing repayments that are deferred and borrowers/customers will need to honour the deferred repayments in the future.</p> <p>Borrowers/customers are advised to contact their banking institutions to discuss on the options available to resume repayments after the deferment period.</p> <p>Q: Do I need to apply?</p> <p>No. All individual and SME loans/financing (excluding credit cards) that meet the criteria will automatically qualify for the deferment.</p> <p>Q: My loan/financing is in default, can I qualify? Can loans under rescheduling and restructuring (R&amp;R) programme be eligible for the deferment package?</p> <p>Loans/financing accounts that are already more than 90 days in arrears will not qualify for the deferment. Borrower/customers are advised to approach their banks to seek assistance.</p> <p>Loans/financing under R&amp;R programme is also eligible for the deferment subject to meeting the criteria.</p> <p>Q: How is the deferment package different from the other loan/financing moratoriums announced by banks recently?</p> <p>Banks and development financial institutions (DFIs) have been proactive in responding to the needs of their borrowers/customers with various rescheduling and restructuring packages offered to assist affected borrowers/customers. Such efforts are welcomed and encouraged during these challenging times.</p> <p>Borrowers/customers that have accepted assistance from banks and DFIs to reschedule and restructure their loans/financing can opt out of such arrangement, if they wish to do so.</p> <p>Q: Which banks offer this deferment package?</p> <p>All licensed banks, licensed Islamic banks and prescribed DFIs regulated by Bank Negara will offer this deferment flexibility. Borrowers/customers that meet the eligibility criteria can avail themselves to this flexibility automatically.</p> <p>Q: How do I know if my bank has enrolled my loan/financing into the deferment package? How do I know if I have qualified?</p> <p>Banking institutions will provide individuals and SME borrowers/customers with adequate information that their loan/financing repayments have been deferred under this scheme.</p> <p>Such information may be provided through a general advisory issued to borrowers/customers through appropriate channels, and/or published on banking institutions’ websites.</p> <p>Q: I want to continue with my loan/financing repayments. How do I opt-out of the automatic deferment package?</p> <p>You should contact your bank if you wish to opt-out of the automatic deferment package, or continue to make timely and full repayment of your loan/financing.</p> <p>Q: I work in the tourism sector and have been badly affected by recent events. I have been struggling to meet my monthly mortgage payments since January and my savings are soon running dry. Do I qualify for the deferment package?</p> <p>Yes, provided that your loan/financing is not in arrears for more than 90 days as at April 20,2020.</p> <p>Q: I run a small business which has been severely affected by Covid-19. If business does not improve, I will soon be defaulting on my car and personal loans/financing? Do I qualify for the deferment package?</p> <p>Yes, provided that your loans/financing are not in arrears for more than 90 days as at April 1,2020.</p> <p>Q: Will I be charged additional interest on the repayment amount that is deferred by six months during the period?</p> <p>For conventional loans, interest will continue to be charged on the outstanding balance comprising both principal and interest portion (i.e. compounded) during the moratorium period.</p> <p>For Islamic financing, profit will continue to accrue on the outstanding principal amount. Such profit, however, will not be compounded in line with syariah principles.</p> <p>Banks are, however, not allowed to impose late penalty charges on the deferred amount. In other words, the loan/financing repayment is just deferred by six months.</p> <p>Q: What would happen to my loan/financing repayments after the deferment package period? How does being in the deferment package affect my interest payments after the 6-month period? Is there an increase in monthly payments, or longer tenure?</p> <p>Interest/profit will continue to accrue on loan/financing repayments that are deferred. This means accumulated repayment amount during the deferment of repayment period will be added to the outstanding loan/financing amount.</p> <p>Borrowers/customers are advised to contact their banking institutions to discuss on the suitable workout plans to repay the principal and interest accrued during the deferment period. This may include higher subsequent installment amount or an extension of the loan/financing tenure.</p> <p>Q: Does this deferment package apply to newly approved/disbursed loans?</p> <p>It applies to all loans/financing outstanding as at April 1,2020.</p> <p>Q: Would my loans with other non-bank credit providers qualify for this deferment package?</p> <p>No, this is only applicable to loans or financing offered by financial institutions regulated by Bank Negara, namely banks and development financial institutions.</p> <p>Q: If a corporation opts in for a loan or financing repayment deferment package, would it still be able to get new financing from banks?</p> <p>Yes. The credit decisions of financial institutions are subject to their respective internal credit policies and assessment.</p> <p>Q: As a corporation, what would be the criteria to opt-in?</p> <p>Unlike individuals and SME borrowers/customers, corporate borrowers/customers should refer to their banks for the deferment and rescheduling and restructuring of their loans/financing.</p> <p>In addition, these loans/financing must meet these criteria:</p> <p>&gt; not in arrears exceeding 90 days as at April 1,2020; and</p> <p>&gt; denominated in ringgit.</p> <p>Q: I have a loan/financing which is automatically deducted from my salary. Do I qualify for the deferment?</p> <p>Yes. Please inform your company to stop the salary deduction if you wish to have your loan/financing repayments deferred. You should also contact your bank to inform them accordingly.</p> <p>Q: How should I notify the bank that I wish to opt-out of the deferment offer?</p> <p>Please respond to the notification sent by the bank and inform that you wish to opt-out of the automatic deferment package, or continue to make timely and full repayment of your loan/financing.</p> <p>Q: Will the bank automatically stop the repayment requirement if I did not respond to their notification?</p> <p>Yes.</p> <p>Q: I have two credit cards with big amounts outstanding, and I was retrenched in January. I have not been able to meet my credit card monthly obligations since January and am worried of the consequences. Will I qualify for the conversion of these outstanding balances into term loans/financing? How does it work? Do I need to call my bank to effect this?</p> <p>If you have been unable to meet the minimum monthly repayment on your credit card consecutively for the last three months, your card issuer will convert the outstanding balance into a term loan of not more than three years at an effective interest of not more than/financing 13% per annum.</p> <p>Q: I heard that banks will now provide automatic conversion of credit card balances into term loans/financing, but I have a monthly salary of about RM5,500. Will I qualify for this conversion package by banks?</p> <p>Banks will convert the outstanding credit card balances of cardholders who are unable to meet the minimum monthly repayment consecutively for the last three months, regardless of the income levels of the cardholders</p> <p>Q: Can credit cardholders who have converted their card balances into a term loan/financing immediately ask for six months deferment of loan or financing repayment package?</p> <p>Yes, they can. Loan/financing repayment resumes after the deferment period.</p> <p>Q: If my credit card outstanding balances is converted to a term loan/financing, can I still use my credit card?</p> <p>Yes, you can continue to use the credit card up to the remaining credit limit after taking into account the balance converted into a term loan/financing. The outstanding balance converted into the term loan/financing is treated as part of the credit card limit. In addition, the monthly term loan/financing instalments will then form part of the minimum monthly repayment amount on the credit card.</p>\n",

      "<p> </p> <p>BANK Negara has issued a FAQ on the six-month loan repayment moratorium, which clarified that borrowers need not apply as the process is automatic.</p> <p>The central bank also clarified that the interest will continue to accrue during the deferment period. This could result in higher subsequent instalment amount or an extension of the loan tenure.</p> <p>Below is the FAQ in full.</p> <p><strong>Q. What is deferment of loan or financing repayment?</strong><br/><br/>it is a temporary deferment or suspension of loan/financing repayment obligation (principal and interest) for a limited period of time.</p> <p>During this period, borrowers/customers with loan/financing that meet the conditions do not need to make any repayment, and no late payment charges or penalties will be imposed.</p> <p>Interest/profit will continue to accrue on loan/financing repayments that are deferred and borrowers/customers will need to honour the deferred repayments in the future. Loan/financing repayment resumes after the deferment period.</p> <p><strong>Q. What is the objective of the deferment package?</strong><br/><br/>The aim of this package is to provide some relief to individuals and businesses who face temporary financial constraints arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>We hope that this will help individuals and businesses facing financial adversities to cope with challenges during this period. Loan/financing repayment resumes after the deferment period.</p> <p><strong>Q. Which loan/financing qualifies for the deferment?</strong><br/><br/>For individuals and small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the deferment in conventional loans or Islamic financing repayment obligations (except credit cards) are automatically effected by banks and development financial institutions (DFIs) if the loans/financing meet these criteria:<br/><br/>• not in arrears exceeding 90 days as at 1 April 2020; and<br/><br/>• denominated in Malaysian Ringgit.</p> <p>Meanwhile, corporate borrowers/customers may request for a moratorium on loan/financing repayment from their respective banks.</p> <p><strong>Q. Can I ask for more than six months deferment?</strong><br/><br/>The deferment is only for six months. Please contact the bank if you require a longer deferment period.</p> <p><strong>Q. If I opt for the deferment, will my CCRIS records be adversely affected?</strong><br/><br/>No. However, interest/profit will continue to accrue on loan/financing repayments that are deferred and borrowers/customers will need to honour the deferred repayments in the future.</p> <p>Borrowers/customers are advised to contact their banking institutions to discuss on the options available to resume repayments after the deferment period.</p> <p><strong>Q. Do I need to apply?</strong><br/><br/>No. All individual and SME loans/financing (excluding credit cards) that meet the criteria will automatically qualify for the deferment.</p> <p><strong>Q. My loan/financing is in default, can I qualify? Can loans under rescheduling and restructuring (R&amp;R) program be eligible for the deferment package?</strong><br/><br/>Loans/financing accounts that are already more than 90 days in arrears, will not qualify for the deferment. Borrower/customers are advised to approach their banks to seek assistance.</p> <p>Loans/financing under R&amp;R program is also eligible for the deferment subject to meeting the criteria.</p> <p><strong>Q. How is the deferment package different from the other loan/financing moratoriums announced by banks recently?</strong><br/><br/>Banks and development financial institutions (DFIs) have been proactive in responding to the needs of their borrowers/customers with various rescheduling and restructuring packages offered to assist affected borrowers/customers. Such efforts are welcomed and encouraged during these challenging times.</p> <p>Borrowers/customers that have accepted assistance from banks and DFIs to reschedule and restructure their loans/financing can opt out of such arrangement, if they wish to do so.</p> <p><strong>Q. Which banks offer this deferment package?</strong><br/><br/>All licensed banks, licensed Islamic banks and prescribed development financial institutions (DFIs) regulated by BNM will offer this deferment flexibility. Borrowers/customers that meet the eligibility criteria can avail themselves to this flexibility automatically.</p> <p><strong>Q. How do I know if my bank has enrolled my loan/financing into the deferment package? How do I know if I have qualified?</strong><br/><br/>Banking institutions will provide individuals and SME borrowers/customers with adequate information that their loan/financing repayments have been deferred under this scheme.</p> <p>Such information may be provided through a general advisory issued to borrowers/customers through appropriate channels, and/or published on banking institutions' websites.</p> <p><strong>Q. I want to continue with my loan/financing repayments. How do I opt-out of the automatic deferment package?</strong><br/><br/>You should contact your bank if you wish to opt-out of the automatic deferment package, or continue to make timely and full repayment of your loan/financing.</p> <p><strong>Q. I work in the tourism sector and have been badly affected by recent events, I have been struggling to meet my monthly mortgage payments since January and my savings are soon running dry. Do I qualify for the deferment package?</strong><br/><br/>Yes, provided that your loan/financing is not in arrears for more than 90 days as at 1 April 2020.</p> <p><strong>Q. I run a small business which has been severely affected by Covid-19, if business does not improve, I will soon be defaulting on my car and personal loans/financing? Do I qualify for the deferment package?</strong><br/><br/>Yes, provided that your loans/financing are not in arrears for more than 90 days as at 1 April 2020.</p> <p><strong>Q. Will I be charged additional interest on the repayment amount that is deferred by 6 months during the period?</strong><br/><br/>For conventional loans, interest will continue to be charged on the outstanding balance comprising of both principal and interest portion (i.e. compounded) during the moratorium period.</p> <p>For Islamic financing, profit will continue to accrue on the outstanding principal amount. Such profit however will not be compounded in line with Shariah principles.</p> <p>Banks are however not allowed to impose late penalty charges on the deferred amount. In other words, the loan/financing repayment is just deferred by 6 months.</p> <p><strong>Q. What would happen to my loan/financing repayments after the deferment package period? How does being in the deferment package affect my interest payments after the 6-month period? Is there an increase in monthly payments, or longer tenure?</strong><br/><br/>Interest/profit will continue to accrue on loan/financing repayments that are deferred. This means accumulated repayment amount during the deferment of repayment period will be added to the outstanding loan/financing amount.</p> <p>Borrowers/customers are advised to contact their banking institutions to discuss on the suitable workout plans to repay the principal and interest accrued during the deferment period. This may include higher subsequent instalment amount or an extension of the loan/financing tenure.<br/><br/><strong>Q. Does this deferment package apply to newly approved/disbursed loans?</strong><br/><br/>It applies to all loans/financing outstanding as at 1 April 2020.</p> <p><strong>Q. Would my loans with other non-bank credit providers qualify for this deferment package?</strong><br/><br/>No, this is only applicable to loans or financing offered by financial institutions regulated by Bank Negara Malaysia, namely banks and development financial institutions.</p> <p><strong>Q. If a corporate opts in for a loan or financing repayment deferment package, would it still be able to get new financing from banks?</strong><br/><br/>Yes. The credit decisions of financial institutions are subject to their respective internal credit policies and assessment.</p> <p><strong>Q. As a corporate, what would be the criteria to opt-in?</strong><br/><br/>Unlike individuals and SME borrowers/customers, corporate borrowers/customers should refer to their banks for the deferment and rescheduling and restructuring of their loans/financing.</p> <p>In addition, these loans/financing must meet these criteria: • not in arrears exceeding 90 days as at 1 April 2020; and • denominated in Malaysian Ringgit.</p> <p><strong>Q. I have a loan/financing which is automatically deducted from my salary. Do I qualify for the deferment?</strong><br/><br/>Yes. Please inform your company to stop the salary deduction if you wish to have your loan/financing repayments deferred. You should also contact your bank to inform them accordingly.</p> <p><strong>Q. How should I notify the bank that I wish to opt-out of the deferment offer?</strong><br/><br/>Please respond to the notification sent by the bank and informed that you wish to opt-out of the automatic deferment package, or continue to make timely and full repayment of your loan/financing.</p> <p><strong>Q. Will the bank automatically stop the repayment requirement if I did not respond to their notification?</strong><br/><br/>Yes.</p> <p><strong>Q. I have two credit cards with big amounts outstanding, and I was retrenched in January. I have not been able to meet my credit card monthly obligations since January and am very worried of the consequences. Will I qualify for the conversion of these outstanding balances into term loans/financing? How does it work? Do I need to call my bank to effect this?</strong><br/><br/>If you have been unable to meet the minimum monthly repayment on your credit card consecutively for the last three months, your card issuer will convert the outstanding balance into a term loan of not more than 3 years at an effective interest of not more than/financing 13 percent per annum.</p> <p><strong>Q. I heard that banks will now provide automatic conversion of credit card balances into term loans/financing, but I have a monthly salary of about RM5,500. Will I qualify for this conversion package by banks?</strong><br/><br/>Banks will convert the outstanding credit card balances of cardholders who are unable to meet the minimum monthly repayment consecutively for the last three months, regardless of the income levels of the cardholders<br/><br/><strong>Q. Can credit cardholders who have converted their card balances into a term loan/financing immediately ask for 6 months deferment of loan or financing repayment package?</strong><br/><br/>Yes, they can. Loan/financing repayment resumes after the deferment period.</p> <p><strong>Q. If my credit card outstanding balances is converted to a term loan/financing, can I still use my credit card?</strong><br/><br/>Yes, you can continue to use the credit card up to the remaining credit limit after taking into account the balance converted into a term loan/financing. The outstanding balance converted into the term loan/financing is treated as part of the credit card limit. In addition, the monthly term loan/financing instalments will then form part of the minimum monthly repayment amount on the credit card.</p> <p> </p>\n",

      "<p>PETALING JAYA: Bank Kerjasama Rakyat Malaysia Bhd (Bank Rakyat), which is known for its strength in the personal financing space, aims to expand its financing to the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and cooperatives.</p> <p>Almost 80% of its total financing portfolio is made up of personal financing, while the remaining 20% is for car and home loans as well as cooperatives financing.</p> <p>“Our aim is to grow more sustainably in the long run, and that includes diversifying our financing portfolio. We want to reduce personal financing to 70% of our total financing in the coming years as we grow our home, auto, SME and cooperative financing, ” newly appointed CEO Datuk Rosman Mohamed (pic)told StarBiz.</p> <p>Rosman took over the helm of the biggest Islamic cooperative in the country and the second-largest Islamic financial institution in terms of assets on Feb 1.</p> <p>Having built his career in Saudi Arabia, Rosman came on the board of the bank last April before becoming acting managing director in August.</p> <p>The lender is on a five-year strategic roadmap known as the “Bank Rakyat 2025” (BR25) programme to future-proof its business.</p> <p>Rosman explained that under BR25, the bank has identified five main blueprints, namely, digitalisation, great customer experience, human capital development, SMEs value creation centre, and sustainability and syariah leadership.</p> <p>“While digitalisation will be our main focus in the coming years, we have no plan to close down any of our 147 branches nationwide.</p> <p>“We are planning to transform about 30 of our branches into digital outlets, ” he said.</p> <p>He added that the bank has invested in a new banking system called Core Banking System that is targeted to be operational in June would include a mobile banking app.</p> <p>Bank Rakyat, which is under the Entrepreneur Development and Cooperatives Ministry is also targeting to play a bigger role in growing the cooperatives sector.</p> <p>The government is targeting the turnover of cooperatives to grow to RM60bil by 2030 from RM40.3bil in 2018.</p> <p>There are about 14,000 cooperatives in Malaysia, of which some 10,000 are active.</p> <p>Bank Rakyat was set up in 1954 with the mandate to raise the social and economic status of rural communities, provide opportunities for self-improvement and to build a better future for the underprivileged.</p> <p>Unlike other banks, Bank Rakyat is a cooperative bank and it is one of the country’s development financial institutions (DFIs).</p> <p>The difference between commercial banks and the DFIs is that the latter was set up by the government to carry specific mandate to develop and promote key sectors that are shunned by commercial banks.</p> <p>The other DFIs are Bank Pembangunan Malaysia Bhd, Small Medium Enterprise Development Bank Malaysia Bhd (SME Bank), Export-Import Bank of Malaysia Bhd (EXIM Bank), Bank Kerjasama Rakyat Malaysia Bhd, Bank Simpanan Nasional and Bank Pertanian Malaysia Bhd (Agrobank).</p> <p>Rosman highlighted that the Bank Rakyat’s financing to cooperatives and SMEs is currently small, which stood at RM2.5bil in 2018, in comparison to personal financing at RM54.88bil.</p> <p>He hoped the bank’s financing to cooperatives and SMEs would double to RM5bil by end-2025.</p> <p>“We are going to open centres that are not only to provide finances but also advice to SMEs.</p> <p>“We need to carve our niche in this sector and micro-financing is also something that we are looking into, ” Rosman said.</p> <p>He pointed out that Bank Rakyat’s personal financing has been doing well and the automatic salary deductions for the civil servant segment has kept the bank’s gross impaired financing (GIF) ratio at below 2%.</p> <p>Aside from expanding its lending portfolio, Bank Rakyat is also looking into ramping up its Current Account Savings Account (CASA) deposits.</p> <p>“Our CASA is one of the lowest in the banking industry and our plan is to approach local masjid to deposits with us aside from expanding our customers base, ” Rosman said.</p>\n",

Nasional Bhd have received the approval of Bank Negara to commence negotiations under the first phase of the government’s proposed merger involving the country’s development financial institutions (DFIs).</p> <p>BPMB in a statement said that negotiations between the two DFIs are expected to be completed within six months from Bank Negara’s approval.</p> <p>In Budget 2020, the government had proposed to merge four DFIs, namely, BPMB, Danajamin, Export-Import Bank of Malaysia Bhd (Exim Bank) and Small Medium Enterprise Development Bank Malaysia Bhd (SME Bank) to strengthen the development finance ecosystem via a two-phased restructuring plan to form a new financial institution.</p> <p>The first phase of the restructuring plan will involve the merger of BPMB with Danajamin, and the second phase to merge Exim Bank and SME Bank into the earlier merged entity.</p> <p>The smooth implementation of the restructuring plan would be overseen by a steering committee, led by the Finance Ministry.</p> <p>The steering committee consists of representatives from Credit Guarantee Corp Malaysia Bhd, Bank Negara and the four DFIs, as well as relevant stakeholder ministries including the Economic Affairs Ministry, the Entrepreneur Development Ministry and the International Trade and Industry Ministry.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a working committee, which would provide updates on the merger progress, would also support the steering committee in driving the implementation of the key integration aspects of the merger.</p> <p>Given the expected merger of the four DFIs, a banking analyst from Kenanga Research told StarBiz that the merger is expected to largely tap the financing for entrepreneurs as well as SMEs, driven by BPMB’s mandate to provide medium and long-term financing to the strategic sectors of the economy.</p> <p>“Right now, getting financing for the SME sector is tough, given the weak business sentiment.</p> <p>“Hence, conventional banks see the SME market and unsecured businesses as high risk to provide financing.</p> <p>“However, this merger would extend its financing to the SME business which is a big market as it faces difficulty in getting financing from conventional banks, ” he added.</p> <p>Overall, SME lending is seeing faster growth than total loan growth this year, according to MIDF Research senior analyst Imran Yassin.</p> <p>BPMB was incorporated in 1973 with the role of assisting entrepreneurs involved in SME industries through the provision of various financing facilities, training and advisory services, particularly to bumiputra entrepreneurs.Through its wholly owned subsidiary Pembangunan Leasing Corp Sdn Bhd (PLC), BPMB also provides financing to SME businesses including those involved in manufacturing, construction, supply, transportation, agriculture, hospitality and information technology.</p> <p>As of Dec 31,2018, BPMB had a combined asset value of RM24.7bil, reflecting that the group is well-positioned to meet the financing and business development needs of Malaysian businesses in the priority sectors.</p> <p>With the global economy slowing down, the analyst noted that merging Danajamin could be useful in the merger, as the bank would be able to capitalise the banking system should there be a rise in non-performing loans, moving forward.</p> <p>“This merger would strengthen the capital adequacy ratio, so it can continue to expand its lending to the SME sector and unsecured businesses, ” he added.</p> <p>The government’s proposal to merge four DFIs in the country could create an entity with a larger balance sheet that, in turn, could result in greater efficiencies and better cost controls.</p> <p>However, with these institutions serving different mandates, the operational side would be something that the government would need to address, according to industry players.</p> <p>Another likely issue that could crop up with the proposed merger is staffing, where there will bound to be duplications and overlaps in some operations, post-merger.</p> <p>Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said in his Budget 2020 presentation that DFIs played an important role as public institutions that support the nation’s development goals and serve the needs and requirements of the new economy.</p> <p>The possible merger of local DFIs in Malaysia’s already crowded and competitive banking space had been discussed sometime back, but did not take off.</p> <p>Previously, in a statement issued by BPMB, it said that the proposal to strengthen the DFI eco-system is a “positive development.”</p> <p>“Our business lines are complementary to the other institutions, and the proposal will lead to greater synergies that would benefit all stakeholders, as well as fulfil the needs of the new economy, ” it added.</p> <p>DFIs in Malaysia were established in the 1960s and 1970s as specialised financial institutions with specific mandates to develop strategic sectors, spanning agriculture, infrastructure, SMEs, as well as export-oriented and high-technology industries.</p> <p>Notably, in 2008, SME Bank was made a separate entity from its parent company, the BPMB group.</p> <p>For the year ended Dec 31,2018, BPMB’s net profit fell 21.5% to RM167.31mil, due to higher allowance for impairment losses on loans and financing of RM423.22mil versus RM302.78mil a year earlier.</p> <p>Last year, Bank Negara collaborated with the World Bank and DFIs to develop an enhanced performance measurement framework for DFIs.</p> <p>The central bank said it sought to provide a sharper focus in the mandates of DFIs, while optimising performance and synergies.</p> <p>It aims to capture the broader contributions of DFIs by moving beyond the narrow focus of financing growth indicators, and integrating developmental key performance indicators to measure the socio-economic impact of DFI operations.</p>\n",

      "                A WEEK before the tabling of Budget 2020, this column highlighted that the budget will likely be a non-event as far as the market is concerned for the simple reason that the government’s finances are tight and it cannot simply afford the many wishes of the wide range of stakeholders.<br/><br/>While economic projections came within expectations, especially with respect to the budget deficit target of 3.2% and development expenditure of RM56bil, the projected revenue and expenditure were off by 4% each as they came in higher than expected.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the projected current balance of RM3.5bil was just slightly above the forecast RM3bil.<br/><br/>The Budget 2020 tabled last week is looking at economic growth of 4.8%, which is within the expected range of between 4.5% and 5%. It will be challenging, given the expected growth is to be mainly driven by private consumption, smaller contraction in public investment and but dragged by a drop in net exports as imports growth is expected to surpass exports next year. On the supply side, the significant contribution from the construction sector growth is not a surprise given some of the mega projects will likely kick off next year, while the services sector too is expected to be sustained at more than 6% growth.<br/><br/>Budget 2020 had several hits and misses. While it raised minimum wage to RM1,200, it is still short of the RM1,500 target.<br/><br/>At the same time the call to widen the tax revenue base was not fulfilled. The introduction of a new tax bracket of 30% for high income earners of above RM2mil a year is insufficient as it is only an incremental increase of two percentage points. The Finance Minister failed to introduce, or at least prepare Malaysians, to accept new taxes, especially Inheritance Tax and Capital Gains Tax.<br/><br/>The property market got a major boost with the lowering of the threshold price to RM600,000 from RM1mil for completed high rise condominiums and apartments that can be sold to foreign buyers beginning next year for a period of one year.<br/><br/>Hopefully, this would help developers sitting on these types of properties and to clear the existing overhang in the market. In addition, the Rent-To-Own scheme is good for first-time home buyers while the change in the base year for the purposes of Real Property Gains Tax (RPGT) to the year 2013 from 2000 is a welcome relief, although still not widely accepted. For administrative purposes, it is always better to calculate RPGT to the year the property is purchased and not any base year as valuation of a property at a given point of time in history is very subjective.<br/><br/>Budget 2020 was a positive surprise for those in the technology and in the electrical and electronics (E&amp;E) sector while the sin sectors were obviously sparred this time around, with the exception of a reduction in special draws for the number forecasting operators (NFO). The proposed merger of the four Development Financial Institutions (DFI) was another surprise and hopefully when that is done, the merged entity will be the next mega IPO to be listed on Bursa Malaysia.<br/><br/>For the environment as well as to promote green initiatives, the proposals made under the Budget are indeed welcome and could spur renewal energy further. With the target to achieve 20% of energy production by 2025, the introduction of a 70% income tax exemption of up to 10 years to companies undertaking solar leasing activities could spur higher demand among consumers.<br/><br/>But this could only happen if prices of solar panels became more attractive and the cost savings from the income tax reliefs are actually passed on to consumers. The problem among consumers is the upfront cost of putting up solar panels on their roofs as it can be as high as almost RM4,000 per KW peak or kWp.<br/><br/>Malaysia is also expected to see an accelerated pace of investments flowing into the country as the government’s move to establish a special channel via InvestKL to attract investments from China is seen positive. Despite a temporary truce to the US-China trade war over the weekend, nothing is certain just yet as to how the trade tariffs will pan out over the next few weeks. Placing Malaysia as a destination of choice for foreign direct investments is crucial as it signals our readiness in attracting long term investments which can create job opportunities and generate economic expansion. The setting up of the National Committee on Investment (NCI) is also a step in the right direction to spur and expedite inward investment activities.<br/><br/>The Budget 2020 was indeed a comprehensive document covering all Malaysians and indeed what better way than to focus on two main critical issues – cost of living and jobs.<br/><br/>The budget did not fail in this aspect as there were various incentives to address cost of living issues, including the newly introduced fuel subsidy mechanism, a free RM30 e-wallet deposit into accounts of entitled persons and last but not least, a 18% reduction for PLUS highway users effective New Year’s Day next year.<br/><br/>The toll issue has dragged on for far too long and with the tabling of the Budget 2020, we are now seeing some light at the end of the tunnel. When the Minister highlighted that the 18% reduction in toll translates to about RM1.13bil, it seems to suggest that the current shareholders of PLUS, the EPF and Khazanah, are likely to forgo any future dividends with the reduction.<br/><br/>With the commitment from the government that extension period for toll concessionaires is not going to be extended, it is likely the two or three proposals that are siting on the desk of the Minister or the Prime Minister will continue to collect dust.<br/><br/>Their proposals, while entailing even larger discounts than that proposed by the Minister, lack the commitment to end tolling in 2038. Hence, it is likely that their proposals are not going to see the light of day. Given the unspoken line, it is now likely that either Khazanah or the EPF to take the lead to buy out one or the other. Logically, as the ability to pay dividends to shareholders has now be diminished, it would make sense for Khazanah to acquire the 49% not already owned from EPF.<br/><br/>All in, the Budget 2020 was a comprehensive document towards the government’s new mantra towards Shared Prosperity Vision 2030. It was, for once, a budget for the people and inclusive as well as far reaching. Kudos to the Pakatan Harapan government. Well done!<br/><br/>Now, the tough and hard part – to implement the proposals as promised.<br/><br/><strong>The views expressed here are the writer’s own.</strong>\n",

      "<p>THE proposal to merge four development financial institutions (DFIs) in the country could create an entity with a larger balance sheet that, in turn, could result in greater efficiencies and better cost controls.</p> <p>However, with these institutions serving different mandates, the operational side would be something that the government would need to address, according to industry players.</p> <p>Another likely issue that could crop up with the proposed merger is staffing, where there will bound to be duplications and overlaps in some operations, post-merger.</p> <p>Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said in his Budget 2020 presentation that Bank Negara is proposing a two-phase restructuring plan for the country’s DFIs to form a new financial institution through the merger of Bank Pembangunan Malaysia Bhd, Danajamin Nasional Bhd, SME Bank and Export-Import Bank of Malaysia Bhd to strengthen the development finance ecosystem.</p> <p>He said that DFIs play an important role as public institutions that support the nation’s development goals and serve the needs and requirements of the new economy.</p> <p>The possible merger of local DFIs in Malaysia’s already crowded and competitive banking space had been discussed sometime back, but did not take off.</p> <p>DFIs, in turn, have come under scrutiny following recent scandals at some institutions such as Bank Pembangunan, which have since seen a revamp.</p> <p>Bank Pembangunan in a statement says the proposal to strengthen the DFI eco-system is a “positive development.”</p> <p>“Our business lines are complementary to the other institutions, and the proposal will lead to greater synergies that would benefit all stakeholders, as well as fulfill the needs of the new economy, ” it adds.</p> <p>DFIs in Malaysia were established in the 1960s and 1970s as specialised financial institutions with specific mandates to develop strategic sectors, spanning agriculture, infrastructure, small and medium enterprises, as well as export-oriented and high-technology industries.</p> <p>Notably, in 2008, SME Bank was made a separate entity from its parent company, the Bank Pembangunan group.</p> <p>For the year ended Dec 31,2018, Bank Pembangunan’s net profit fell 21.5% to RM167.31mil, due to higher allowance for impairment losses on loans and financing of RM423.22mil versus RM302.78mil a year earlier.</p> <p>Last year, Bank Negara collaborated with the World Bank and DFIs to develop an enhanced performance measurement framework for DFIs.</p> <p>The central bank said it sought to provide a sharper focus in the mandates of DFIs, while optimising performance and synergies.</p> <p>It aims to capture the broader contributions of DFIs by moving beyond the narrow focus of financing growth indicators, and integrating developmental key performance indicators to measure the socio-economic impact of DFI operations.</p>\n",

Improved public-private partnership will further support the SMEs in unlocking their potential.</p> <p>The introduction of the Rent to Own financing scheme will see up to RM10bil provided by financial institutions, with support from the government via a 30% or RM3bil guarantee.

Based on the experience overseas, the success of such a scheme depends on the details and implementation.

Warning lights come in the form of trade tensions, geopolitical disruptions, currency movements, and growth deceleration of major trade partners.</p> <p>I urge the government to be nimble, and if outlook changes, to come out with counter-cyclical measures that buffer the Malaysian economy against deteriorating external environment and economic shocks.</p> <p> </p>\n",

      "<p>PETALING JAYA: Budget 2020 has just been tabled at the Dewan Rakyat by Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng.</p> <p>The Budget with its theme,\"Driving growth and equitable outcomes towards shared prosperity,\" is the second for Pakatan Harapan since the coalition won power.</p> <p>The following is the full text of Lim's speech to Parliament:</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>1. I beg to move the Bill intituled “An Act to apply a sum from the Consolidated Fund for the service of the year 2020 and to appropriate that sum for the service of that year” be read a second time.</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>2. Greetings, Salam Harapan and Salam Sayangi Malaysiaku, I bid to the Honourable Speaker, Honourable Members of Parliament of both the Government and the Opposition, and to all Malaysians. We are grateful that by God’s grace, Malaysia continues to be a peaceful, stable and prosperous nation.</p> <p>3. First and foremost, allow me to convey my undivided loyalty and my congratulations on the coronation of Kebawah Duli Yang Maha Mulia Seri Paduka Baginda Yang Dipertuan Agong Ke-16, Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri’ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah Ibni Almarhum Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Al-Musta’in Billah.</p> <p>4. I am humbled to stand before you to table the 2020 Budget. This is the second budget to be tabled under the Pakatan Harapan Government. Indeed, 2020 is a special year given that Wawasan 2020 was envisioned by our YAB Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir bin Mohamad nearly three decades ago in 1991, to celebrate Malaysia joining the ranks of developed nations. Vision 2020 would have succeeded, if not for the massive financial scandals, corruption and mismanagement of the previous Government.</p> <p>5. The first Pakatan Harapan Budget tabled in 2018 focused on fiscal consolidation and rationalisation, institutional reforms and people-centric policies to right the many wrongs of the previous administration. For this Budget, the theme is on “Driving Growth</p> <p>And Equitable Outcomes Towards Shared Prosperity”. The Government is committed to bringing stability to the Government’s finances and achieving the goal of Vision 2020 with a new growth trajectory under the foundation of “Shared Prosperity Vision 2030” as initiated by YAB Prime Minister, Tun Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad.</p> <p>ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND CHALLENGES</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>6. The global economy has been thrown into a state of uncertainty caused by the trade war between the United States and other nations, especially the People’s Republic of China. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised downwards the global economic growth forecast for the year 2019 from 3.9% in July 2018 to 3.2% in July 2019. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) has also reduced the forecast for world merchandise trade growth for 2019 from 2.6% in April 2019 to 1.2% in October 2019, the lowest since 2009.</p> <p>7. As a trading nation, Malaysia cannot avoid being affected by these external headwinds. However, with economic policies and reforms implemented by the Pakatan Harapan government, our economy will remain resilient. In the first half of 2019, GDP growth was 4.7%, with a growth rate of 4.9% in the 2nd quarter. Indeed, Malaysia is one of the few economies in the world that experienced faster growth in the second quarter compared to the previous quarter.</p> <p>8. The Government has also been very successful in taming inflation, with 0.2% recorded in the first half of 2019 compared to 1.0% and 3.7% for the whole of 2018 and 2017 respectively. Clearly the Goods and Services Tax (GST) implemented under the previous regime had contributed significantly to higher prices. By abolishing the GST of 6% in June 2018 and replacing it with the Sales and Services Tax (SST) regime in September 2018, the country’s inflation rate has been reduced to its lowest levels since 2007. For the full year of 2019, the inflation rate is expected to be at 0.9%. To respect the mandate given by the Rakyat in last year’s General Elections, the Government does not intend to bring back GST.</p> <p>9. Despite the global trade war, Malaysian exports only shrank marginally for the first 8 months of 2019 by 0.4% from a year ago. Malaysian exports are still expected to record positive growth for 2019. During the same period, Malaysia recorded RM92.5 billion worth of trade surplus, which is 28.7% larger than the RM71.9 billion recorded during the same period in 2018.</p> <p>10. This healthy trade balance will keep the country’s current account in surplus for the year. Overall, Malaysia’s balance of payments continues to be firmly positive, with the current account surplus for 2019 is expected at RM43.4 billion or 2.9% of Gross National Income (GNI). Meanwhile, as at 30 September 2019 our international reserves remain healthy at RM431.3 billion or USD103 billion, which is sufficient to finance 7.6 months of retained imports and is 1.1 times of our external short-term debts.</p> <p>11. The Malaysian financial system also remains sound and stable, despite a challenging global environment and high degree of volatility in the international financial markets throughout the year.</p> <p>2020 BUDGET THEME - DRIVING GROWTH AND EQUITABLE OUTCOMES TOWARDS SHARED PROSPERITY</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>12. We as Malaysians have a shared responsibility to rebuild the nation. Therefore, extensive consultations for Budget 2020 with stakeholders were undertaken. On top of the Budget Consultation hosted at the Ministry of Finance, we had a total of 12 Focus Group sessions held together with other Ministries and state governments all around the country involving over 2,500 people representing over 1,200 organisations.</p> <p>13. The four thrusts anchoring the 2020 Budget are:</p> <p>FIRST: Driving Economic Growth in the New Economy and</p> <p>Digital Era</p> <p>SECOND: Investing in Malaysians: Levelling Up Human Capital</p> <p>THIRD: Creating a United, Inclusive and Equitable Society</p> <p>FOURTH: Revitalisation of Public Institutions and Finances</p> <p>FIRST THRUST: DRIVING ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE NEW ECONOMY AND DIGITAL ERA</p> <p>Strategy 1: Making Malaysia the Preferred Destination for Investment</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>14. During YAB Tun Dr Mahathir’s first stint as the Prime Minister, he led Malaysia to its fastest decade of economic growth from 1988 to 1997 at an average annual GDP growth rate of 9.3%, marking the country’s ascent to be an Asian Economic Tiger. The influx of Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) had not only brought in new jobs with better wages, new businesses into the market and new economic opportunities, it also structurally upgraded Malaysia from being an agriculture-based domestic-centric economy into an industrialised export-oriented nation.</p> <p>15. However, at the turn of the century, Malaysia’s economic growth tapered off to an average of 5.1% since 2000. The premature deindustrialisation of the Malaysian economy resulted in the shift of our economy to one that is more reliant on labour intensive, lowskill, and low-cost structure. As a result, we remain trapped as a middle-income nation that has been hindered from becoming a truly developed economy based on productivity, innovation and shared prosperity.</p> <p>Trade War Opportunities</p> <p>16. The protracted trade war creates a unique opportunity for Malaysia to again be the preferred destination for high value-added Foreign Direct Investments (FDI). The shift in the global supply chain investments has witnessed approved FDI increasing by 47% to RM80.1 billion in 2018 from RM54.4 billion in 2017.</p> <p>17. For the first half of this year, approved FDI increased by 97% to RM49.5 billion from RM25.1 billion in the same period last year.</p> <p>The approved manufacturing FDI from the United States of America (US) was the highest at RM11.7 billion, followed by the People’s Republic of China at RM4.8 billion. As China is our largest trading partner, FDI from China should be comparable with the US. As such, a ‘Special Channel’ to attract investments from China shall be established under InvestKL.</p> <p>18. To overcome delays in approving foreign and domestic investments, we have established the National Committee on Investment (NCI), jointly chaired by the Minister of Finance and the Minister of International Trade and Industry. In our inaugural meeting on 28 August this year, three investments worth RM2.2 billion were approved.</p> <p>19. This year, the Government has embarked on a comprehensive review and revamp of the existing incentive framework, comprising the Promotion of Investments Act 1986, Special Incentive Package and incentives under the Income Tax Act 1967. This new framework is expected to be ready by 1 January 2021.</p> <p>20. The Government will make available up to RM1 billion worth of customised packaged investment incentives annually over 5 years, as part of the strategic push to attract targeted Fortune 500 companies and global unicorns in high technology, manufacturing, creative and new economic sectors. To qualify, these companies must invest at least RM5 billion each in Malaysia which will generate additional economic activities that will support our Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs), create 150,000 high quality jobs over the next 5 years and strengthen our manufacturing and service ecosystems.</p> <p>21. To transform Malaysia’s best and most promising businesses into the most competitive enterprises in global export markets, the Government will also make available up to RM1 billion in customised packaged investment incentives annually over 5 years.</p> <p>These incentives are strictly conditional upon these companies proving their ability to grow and export their products and services globally. We expect this measure to significantly strengthen our local supply chain ecosystem and create additional 100,000 high quality jobs for Malaysians over the next 5 years.</p> <p>22. In addition to expediting approval of investments, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) will give additional focus on post-approval investment monitoring and realisation. For this purpose, the Government will allocate RM10 million.</p> <p>23. The Government will also provide tax incentives to further promote high-value added activities in the Electrical and Electronics (E&amp;E) industry to transition into 5G digital economy and Industry</p> <p>4.0. These incentives include:</p> <p>First: income tax exemption up to 10 years to E&amp;E companies</p> <p>investing in selected knowledge-based services; and</p> <p>Second: special Investment Tax Allowance to encourage</p> <p>companies in E&amp;E sector that have exhausted the Reinvestment Allowance to further reinvest in Malaysia.</p> <p>24. In addition, to encourage automation and to increase company’s productivity, it is proposed:</p> <p>First: Accelerated Capital Allowance and automation equipment</p> <p>capital allowance for manufacturing sector on the first RM2 million and RM4 million incurred on qualifying capital expenditure is extended to the year of assessment 2023; and</p> <p>Second: The incentive is also be expanded to include services</p> <p>sector on the first RM2 million incurred on qualifying capital expenditure from the year of assessment 2020 to the year of assessment 2023.</p> <p>Improving Competitiveness</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>25. The Pakatan Harapan Government is committed to continuously improve the business climate in Malaysia. One of the key reforms to be implemented is to improve the ease of doing business in Malaysia by reducing the number of steps to register a business.</p> <p>26. It goes without saying that well-functioning ports and logistics system is crucial for a trading nation like ours. The World Economic Forum (WEF) 2019 Global Competitiveness Report ranks Malaysia’s sea transport infrastructures is one of the best in the world.</p> <p>27. Port Klang is currently the 12th busiest container port in the world and is expected to reach full capacity in the next five years. For the next phase of growth, the Government is undertaking an indepth feasibility study on the development of Pulau Carey. This is to make Port Klang as a regional maritime centre and cargo logistics hub combining manufacturing, distribution, cargo consolidation, bunkering and ship repairs.</p> <p>28. The Government will allocate RM50 million for the repair and maintenance of roads leading to Port Klang. The Ministry of Transport will commence feasibility studies on the Serendah-Port Klang Rail Bypass for cargo shipments and the Klang Logistics Corridor, a dedicated privatised highway connecting Northport and Westport for commercial vehicles, with both projects estimated to cost RM8.3 billion.</p> <p>29. To better facilitate trade movement through our ports, the Royal Malaysian Customs Department (RMCD) will introduce a deferred payment facility to expedite the clearance process of cross border transactions. This will reduce the time and cost for cross border trade significantly.</p> <p>30. Beyond our sea ports, the Government intends to strengthen trade with Thailand via our 100-acre logistics hub, Kota Perdana Special Border Economic Zone (SBEZ) at Bukit Kayu Hitam. Further to the development of a Truck Depot as announced in Budget 2019, the Government will allocate an additional RM50 million to stimulate public-private partnerships for the project. The Government would provide support for the construction of primary infrastructure, while the private sector will invest in critical business assets to catalyse potential domestic investment worth RM800 million which would provide job opportunities to more than 600 people.</p> <p>31. RM1.1 billion is allocated in 2020 to support projects for corridor development activities including:</p> <p>First: RM50 million for the development of Chuping Valley</p> <p>Industrial Area in Perlis by NCIA;</p> <p>Second: RM69.5 million for the Kuantan Port related projects by ECERDC;</p> <p>Third: RM42 million for the construction of Sungai Segget Centralised Sewerage Treatment Plant in Johor by IRDA;</p> <p>Fourth: RM55 million for infrastructure in the Samalaju</p> <p>Industrial Park in Sarawak by RECODA; and</p> <p>Fifth: RM20 million for the Sabah Agro-Industrial Precinct</p> <p>by SEDIA</p> <p>Strategy 2: Accelerating the Digital Economy</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>Building Digital Infrastructure</p> <p>32. YAB Prime Minister launched Malaysia into the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) era with the establishment of the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) in 1996. We are now entering the digital era. This Government is committed towards digital transformation.</p> <p>33. For the past year, the regulatory reforms implemented by the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) on the Mandatory Standard on Access Pricing (MSAP) has successfully lowered broadband prices by 49% and triggered a shift in consumer demand for faster internet connections. The World Bank has praised the Government for accelerating average broadband speed by 3 times in just one year.</p> <p>34. Now, the Government will create the necessary infrastructure to construct a Digital Malaysia by implementing the National Fiberisation &amp; Connectivity Plan (NFCP) over the next 5 years which will provide comprehensive coverage of high speed and quality digital connectivity nationwide including rural areas. The NFCP will adopt a public private partnership approach involving a total investment of RM21.6 billion. The Government, through MCMC, will finance at least half of the required investment with corresponding investments by the private sector telecommunications players via a matching grant mechanism.</p> <p>35. As part of NFCP, we will improve connectivity in remote areas of Malaysia, especially in Sabah and Sarawak, to ensure that no one is left behind in our digital drive. MCMC will allocate RM250 million to leverage on various technologies, including via satellite broadband connectivity.</p> <p>36. In addition, the Government will allocate RM210 million to accelerate the deployment of new digital infrastructure for public buildings particularly schools and also high impact areas such as industrial parks. Priority will be given to locations within states that are able to facilitate and expedite the implementation of the NFCP.</p> <p>Building Digital Applications</p> <p>37. The vigorous rollout of the NFCP will be key to bringing 5G technology and services to the Malaysian public. To seed technological developments by Malaysian companies to ride the global 5G wave, which is 100 times faster than 4G, the Government will introduce a 5G Ecosystem Development Grant worth RM50 million.</p> <p>38. In addition, an allocation of RM25 million will be given to set up a contestable matching grant fund to spur more pilot projects on digital applications such as drone delivery, autonomous vehicle, blockchain technology, and other products and services that leverage on our investments in fibre optics and 5G infrastructure.</p> <p>39. Digital content creates economic value. For instance, the global video gaming industry today has revenue upward of USD150 billion, higher than both the music and movie industries combined. Therefore, we will allocate RM20 million to Malaysian Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) to grow local champions in creating digital content, especially in e-Games, animation and digital arts.</p> <p>Building Digital Companies</p> <p>40. To build a Digital Malaysia, the private sector must come onboard. More Malaysian Small Medium Enterprise (SMEs) need to adopt digitalisation measures for their business operations, including electronic Point Of Sale systems (e-POS), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and electronic payroll system. The Government will provide a 50% matching grant of up to RM5,000 per company for the subscription of the above services. This matching grant will be worth RM500 million over 5 years, limited to the first 100,000 SMEs applying to upgrade their systems.</p> <p>41. The Government will also allocate RM550 million to provide Smart Automation matching grants to 1,000 manufacturing and 1,000 services companies to automate their business processes. This grant will be given on a matching basis up to RM2 million per company.</p> <p>42. The Government plans to build up to 14 one-stop Digital Enhancement Centres in all states to facilitate access to financing and capacity building of our businesses, especially SMEs in line with the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR4.0). A budget of RM70 million will be allocated to MDEC to set up these centres as an extension of the ‘100 Go Digital’ programme. To also promote knowledge sharing and education through digital enabled content, the Government proposes to establish 3 new digital libraries in Kedah, Perak and Johor.</p> <p>43. Programmes such as the Coach and Grow Programme (CGP) by Cradle Fund for high impact technology entrepreneurs involving 469 companies to date have generated RM2.3 billion in revenues, including RM300 million in exports. As part of the Government’s continued commitment to promote early stage innovations, the Government will provide RM20 million to Cradle Fund for the provision of training and grants to seed companies.</p> <p>Building Digital Malaysians</p> <p>44. To ensure gains arising from successful Digital Companies are shared with the Rakyat, the Government will introduce the concept of Digital Social Responsibility (DSR). DSR is the commitment by businesses, to contribute to digital economic development while improving the digital skills of the future workforce with initiatives such as technology scholarships, training and upskilling for digital skills for communities in need. Contributions towards DSR by the companies will be given tax deduction.</p> <p>45. We will continue providing funds of RM10 million to MDEC to train micro-digital entrepreneurs and technologists to leverage on e-Marketplaces and social media platforms to sell their products. 100 of these micro-digital entrepreneurs, a majority of whom are women and youth, were able to generate RM23 million in revenues over just 6 months, unleashing life changing experiences.</p> <p>46. The Pakatan Harapan government recognises the growing potential of eSports and will provide an increased allocation of RM20 million for 2020. We wish our Malaysian team the very best of luck to bring home many gold medals from the Southeast Asian Games in Manila in December 2019.</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>47. According to Bank Negara Malaysia’s Financial Sector Blueprint for 2011 to 2020, Malaysia stands to gain about 1% in cost savings to our GDP annually by switching fully to e-payments processes and becoming a cashless society. This is at a time where mobile payment transaction volume had increased twenty-fold to over 34 million transactions in 2018 from just below 2 million transactions in 2017. However, the overall adoption of e-wallet remains low at only 8%, based on a survey report by Nielsen in January this year.</p> <p>48. To significantly increase the number of Malaysians, participating merchants and SMEs to use e-wallets, the Government will offer a one-time RM30 digital stimulus to qualified Malaysians aged 18 and above with annual income less than RM100,000. All you need is to own an identity-verified e-wallet account with selected service providers. The one-time digital stimulus per person can be redeemed and used for a two-month period commencing 1 January 2020 and expiring on 29 February 2020. The Government will allocate up to RM450 million to Khazanah Nasional to implement this digital stimulus, which will benefit up to 15 million Malaysians.</p> <p>Strategy 3: Strengthening Access to Financing for Businesses</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>49. To better facilitate access to financing for SMEs in priority segments, the Government will implement enhancements to the Skim Jaminan Pinjaman Perniagaan (SJPP). For Bumiputera SMEs, export-oriented SMEs and SMEs investing in automation and digitalisation, the Government guarantee will be increased from 70% to 80% and in addition, will reduce the guarantee fee to only 0.75%. A new SJPP allocation of RM500 million in guarantee facility will also be launched, earmarked for women entrepreneurs.</p> <p>50. To further support our up and coming entrepreneurs, SME Bank will introduce two new funds where the Government will provide an annual interest subsidy of 2% to reduce borrowing costs as follows:</p> <p>First: a RM200 million fund specifically for women</p> <p>entrepreneurs, offering loans of up to RM1 million per SME; and</p> <p>Second: a RM300 million fund to support Bumiputera SMEs with</p> <p>the potential to become regional champions, with priority given to producers of halal products and manufacturers with high local content.</p> <p>51. The Government will allocate RM10 million to the Ministry of Entrepreneur Development to focus on advocacy and awareness for halal certification, halal product development and providing platforms for local players to tap on the USD3 trillion global halal market.</p> <p>52. For SMEs to remain competitive, they must continually expand their exports. The Pakatan Harapan Government will increase the ceiling per company for the Market Development Grant (MDG) initiative by Malaysia External Trade Development</p> <p>Corporation (MATRADE) from the current RM200,000 to RM300,000 yearly. At the same time, the ceiling for the participation in each export fair will also be revised upwards from</p> <p>RM15,000 to RM25,000. The Government will also allocate RM50 million to encourage SMEs to engage in more export promotion activities.</p> <p>53. In the era of fintech, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) is finalising the licensing framework for digital banks to be issued by year end for public consultation. The final framework will be issued by the first half of 2020 to invite applications.</p> <p>54. The Government will support and encourage new digital financial innovations such as Equity CrowdFunding (ECF) and</p> <p>Peer-to-Peer (P2P) platforms. Collectively, more than</p> <p>RM430 million was raised as at June 2019, benefitting more than 1,200 SMEs. Building on this early success, the government will further allocate an additional RM50 million to My Co-Investment Fund (MyCIF) under the Securities Commission Malaysia to leverage such platforms to help finance the underserved SMEs.</p> <p>55. To further encourage alternative sources of funding for startups companies and to attract more foreign investment to Malaysia, tax incentives given to venture capital and angel investors will be extended until the year 2023.</p> <p>56. To catalyse and promote financing to construction consortiums bidding for projects and concessions overseas, the Government will provide a RM1 billion 1:5 matching guarantee for dedicated private equity funds to invest in Malaysian consortiums.</p> <p>57. To support Bumiputera entrepreneurial development, grants amounting to RM445 million will be provided in terms of access to financing, provision of business premises and entrepreneur training. This includes:</p> <p>First: RM150 million for overall entrepreneurship development</p> <p>and upskilling by Perbadanan Usahawan Nasional Berhad (PUNB);</p> <p>Second: RM75 million by SME Corporation (SMECorp) for</p> <p>capacity building and export focus for Bumiputera SMEs,</p> <p>which includes enhancing marketing, packaging, and</p> <p>financial literacy;</p> <p>Third:</p> <p>RM170 million in total for access of financing via TEKUN,</p> <p>SME Bank and Pelaburan Hartanah Berhad; and</p> <p>Fourth: RM50 million for entrepreneurship under Unit Peneraju</p> <p>Agenda Bumiputera, Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p> <p>58. The Government will continue to support strategic projects through financing programmes under Bank Pembangunan Malaysia Berhad, offering a 2% interest subsidy per annum via:</p> <p>First: the Sustainable Development Financing Fund size</p> <p>increased from RM1 billion to RM2 billion;</p> <p>Second: the RM1 billion Maritime &amp; Logistics Fund; and</p> <p>Third: the RM2 billion Industry Digitalisation Transformation Fund which will now also support the implementation of connectivity projects.</p> <p>59. Unlike the previous administration, which handed out small business loans to their politically-linked co-operatives the Pakatan Harapan administration has separated politics and public funding, by providing RM100 million for Small Business Loans (Program Pembiayaan Usahawan Perusahaan Kecil Komuniti Cina) for the Chinese community via Bank Simpanan Nasional with more than 380 branches throughout the country, at an interest rate of 4%.</p> <p>60. For Indian entrepreneurs, the Government will provide</p> <p>RM20 million under TEKUN Nasional’s Skim Pembangunan Usahawan Masyarakat India (SPUMI) which is expected to benefit 1,300 entrepreneurs at an interest rate of 4%.</p> <p>Restructuring Development Financial Institutions (DFIs)</p> <p>61. Development Financial Institutions (DFIs) play an important role as public institutions that support the nation’s development goals and serve the needs and requirements of the new economy. To strengthen the development finance ecosystem, Bank Negara Malaysia is proposing a 2-phase restructuring plan for our DFIs to form a new financial institution through the merger of Bank Pembangunan Malaysia, Danajamin Nasional, SME Bank, and the Export-Import Bank of Malaysia.</p> <p>Growing Islamic Finance</p> <p>62. This year, the Ministry of Finance established the Special Committee on Islamic Finance (JKKI) chaired by the Yang Berhormat Deputy Minister of Finance, with the main objective of further promoting and developing the Islamic Finance ecosystem.</p> <p>To position Malaysia as the centre of excellence for Islamic finance, this special committee will:</p> <p>First: formulate the Islamic Economic Blueprint, with all</p> <p>relevant agencies;</p> <p>Second: organise outreach initiatives and professional courses to</p> <p>promote deeper understanding of Islamic Finance nationwide.</p> <p>63. The current tax deductions on the cost of issuance and additional deductions on sukuk issuance costs under the principle of Wakalah will be extended for 5 years until year of assessment 2025.</p> <p>64. To further promote Islamic fund and Sustainable and Responsible Investment (SRI) fund management activity, the tax exemption for fund management companies managing Shariah compliant funds and SRI funds, and the tax deduction on the cost of issuing SRI Sukuk will be extended for another 3 years until year of assessment 2023.</p> <p>Strategy 4: Strengthening Economic Diversity</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>65. In order to achieve economic diversity to expand growth, there will be specific measures on four areas: green economy, agriculture, Research and Development (R&amp;D), and tourism.</p> <p>Green Growth and Energy for the Future</p> <p>66. As part of the liberalisation of the electricity market, the Government has decided to migrate the current power purchase system towards a wholesale market in the future. Renewable energy suppliers will also be able to compete directly in the retail market. The more transparent and competitive electricity market will ensure a lower cost of electricity for Malaysian consumers.</p> <p>67. The Government intends to attain Malaysia’s goal to generate 20% of our energy consumption from renewable sources by 2025. Last year, we had significantly expanded the qualifying list of green assets for Green Investment Tax Allowance (GITA) under the MyHijau directory. For Budget 2020, we are happy to announce that the GITA and Green Income Tax Exemption (GITE) incentives will be extended to 2023. A 70% income tax exemption of up to</p> <p>10 years will be given to companies undertaking solar leasing activities.</p> <p>68. Through Energy Performance Contracting (EPC), the upfront capital investment into energy saving equipment for Government buildings will be repaid through the savings in utility costs achieved. In 2020, the Government will accelerate EPC implementation for Government buildings, prioritising hospitals and education institutions.</p> <p>Commodity Development</p> <p>69. The Government is concerned by the impact of low commodity prices on the livelihoods of Malaysians in this sector, particular the smallholders. At the same time we are disappointed and unhappy with the staged efforts aimed at curtailing market access for our palm oil exports by the European Union (EU) and the United States. For the palm oil sector, this Government intends to support this industry with the following measures:</p> <p>First: RM550 million palm oil replanting loan fund for</p> <p>smallholders collateral-free at an interest rate of 2% per annum, with a tenure of 12 years including a 4 year moratorium on repayment. The replanting will be undertaken using the latest seedlings and also in compliance with Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) standards to ensure better productivity and marketability;</p> <p>Second: An allocation of RM27 million to support Malaysian Palm Oil Board’s (MPOB) efforts to market palm oil internationally and counter anti-palm oil campaigns;</p> <p>Third: Enhance implementation of biodiesel, with the B20</p> <p>biodiesel for the transport sector to be implemented by the end of 2020. This is expected to increase palm oil demand by 500,000 tonnes per annum.</p> <p>70. The Government recognises the hardships caused by low rubber prices and low yield during the rainy seasons. Hence we will allocate RM200 million for Bantuan Musim Tengkujuh to eligible rubber smallholders under RISDA and Lembaga Industri Getah Sabah (LIGS). The Government will provide RM100 million for Rubber Production Incentive in 2020 to enhance the income of smallholders faced with low rubber prices.</p> <p>71. The Government will allocate RM810 million for the welfare of FELDA community, as follows:</p> <p>First: RM250 million for an income enhancement program</p> <p>benefiting 11,600 settlers;</p> <p>Second: RM300 million to write-off the interest of the settlers’</p> <p>debts;</p> <p>Third: RM100 million for the FELDA water supply projects;</p> <p>Fourth: RM70 million for housing the new generation of FELDA</p> <p>settlers; and</p> <p>Fifth: RM90 million for the upgrading of FELDA roads and</p> <p>basic infrastructure.</p> <p>72. Separately, we will provide RM738 million for RISDA and Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority (FELCRA) to implement various income-generating programmes to benefit the more than 300,000 RISDA and 100,000 FELCRA smallholders.</p> <p>Increasing the Incomes of Farmers</p> <p>73. The Government has increased the allocation to the Ministry of Agriculture from RM4.4 billion in 2019 to RM4.9 billion in 2020, with a special focus towards enhancing incomes of farmers.</p> <p>74. For 2020, the Government proposes to increase the fishermen allowance from RM200 to RM250 per month, with a total allocation of RM152 million for 2020.</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>75. To help our farmers, fishermen and smallholders diversify their income, the Government is allocating a sum of RM150 million to facilitate crop integration to help supplement their income such as through chili, pineapple, coconut, watermelon and bamboo.</p> <p>76. Government also intends to make the glutinous rice a signature product of Langkawi Island and provide farmers with a higher income. To support this initiative, the Government will allocate RM30 million for the production of glutinous rice in Langkawi Island which is expected to benefit 1,200 farmers.</p> <p>77. To raise the padi yield, the Government will increase the allocation for padi inputs from RM796 million in 2019 to RM855 million in 2020 under the Skim Baja Padi Kerajaan Persekutuan (SBPKP) and Skim Insentif Pengeluaran Padi (SIPP). In addition, the Government will continue the subsidy for Padi Bukit and Padi Huma.</p> <p>78. Finally, we will allocate RM43 million for Agriculture Industry 4.0 to develop new crop varieties with higher productivity and quality.</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>Enhancing Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) Framework</p> <p>79. Malaysia’s global ranking has improved from 37th in the world in 2017 to 35th in the world in 2019 in the Global Innovation Index</p> <p>(GII) as published by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). However, we must not stop there. We will continue enhancing Malaysia’s R&amp;D framework by:</p> <p>First: Intensifying R&amp;D in the public sector with an</p> <p>allocation of RM524 million to Ministries and Public Agencies;</p> <p>Second: The Government will also allocate RM30 million for R&amp;D</p> <p>matching grants for collaborations with industry and academia to develop higher value added downstream uses of palm oil, specifically tocotrienol in pharmaceuticals and bio-jet fuel; and</p> <p>Third: The Government will establish a Research Management Agency, with an allocation of RM10 million to centralise and coordinate management of public research resources;</p> <p>Fourth:</p> <p>To promote commercialisation of R&amp;D from the public sector, research universities beginning with the</p> <p>University of Malaya, will establish a one-stop Innovation Office to transform intellectual property into commercially exploitable opportunities; and</p> <p>Fifth: IP-generated income based on the Modified Nexus</p> <p>Approach (MNA) derived from patents and copyright software will be given tax exemption for a period of up to 10 years.</p> <p>80. The Government will allocate RM11 million towards initiatives by the Ministry of Education in collaboration with Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Climate Change (MESTECC) to inculcate the Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) culture, encouraging more students into the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>Visit Malaysia 2020</p> <p>81. Visit Malaysia 2020 (VMY2020) is the Government’s primary effort to brand Malaysia as a top destination for tourism, with a target of achieving 30 million tourist arrivals. The Government will continue to allocate 50% of tourism tax to respective State Governments to support their efforts in conjunction with VMY2020. To fulfil the aspirations of VMY2020, the Government has allocated RM1.1 billion to the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture, including an allocation of RM90 million to drive awareness, promotions and programmes for the VMY2020 campaign. A substantial portion of the departure levy collected will be allocated for tourism infrastructure projects.</p> <p>82. To amplify the economic benefits of VMY2020, the Government will roll out a host of tax incentives targeted at the arts and tourism sector, such as:</p> <p>First: Income tax exemption be given for organisers of approved</p> <p>arts and cultural activities, approved international sports recreational competitions, and conferences organisers;</p> <p>Second: New investments in international theme park projects</p> <p>will be given income tax exemption of 100% of statutory income or Investment Tax Allowance of 100% to be set off against 70% for 5 years;</p> <p>Third: Increasing tax deductions given to companies sponsoring</p> <p>arts, cultural and heritage activities in Malaysia from RM700,000 to RM1,000,000 per year;</p> <p>Fourth: Accelerated Capital Allowance for expenditure incurred</p> <p>on the purchase of new locally assembled excursion bus to be fully claimed within 2 years; and</p> <p>Fifth: excise duty exemption of 50% for locally assembled</p> <p>vehicles be given to tour operators for the purchase of qualified new tourism vehicles.</p> <p>83. The funicular train service to Penang Hill will achieve more than 2 million passengers per year, exceeding its capacity. The Government will contribute RM100 million towards the construction of a new cable car system to Penang Hill, with any additional costs to be financed by the State Government.</p> <p>84. In addition, the Government will allocate RM5 million to Cultural Economy Development Agency (CENDANA) to support Malaysian visual art galleries and exhibition organisers in holding art exhibitions. In addition, RM10 million will be allocated to Think City to preserve culture and urban heritage.</p> <p>85. Among the VMY2020 programmes, we are also having Malaysia Year of Healthcare Travel 2020 to solidify Malaysia’s leading position as a medical tourist destination in the region. Medical tourism is a rapidly expanding sector in Malaysia, growing</p> <p>17% annually from 2015 until 2018. In 2018, it generated</p> <p>RM1.5 billion revenue receipts from 1.2 million healthcare travellers. The Government will allocate RM25 million to the Malaysian Healthcare Tourism Council (MHTC) to strengthen the position of Malaysia as the preferred destination for health tourism in ASEAN for oncology, cardiology and fertility treatment.</p> <p>86. To date, e-visa applications are available for 10 countries, including China and India. To facilitate the visa application process, licensed travel agents under the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture (MoTAC) are allowed to submit group application for up to 100 people per transaction through the eNTRI and eVISA system.</p> <p>SECOND THRUST: INVESTING IN MALAYSIANS - LEVELLING UP HUMAN CAPITAL</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>87. Growth is necessary, but not sufficient to ensure Shared Prosperity. Economic growth must see that all Malaysians can participate meaningfully, and the fruits are shared equitably. There are three interrelated challenges that we face now in our labour market that need to be addressed.</p> <p>88. Firstly, we are concerned with more than half a million unemployed Malaysians in 2018, of which roughly 140,000 are graduates. Additionally out of those unemployed, about 290,000 of them were youth up to 24 years old.</p> <p>89. Secondly, the gender gap in our employment remains sizeable despite making significant progress in the past few years with the appointment of the first woman Deputy Prime Minister, Chief Justice and Chief Commissioner of SPRM. Female labour force participation rate continues to stagnate at around 55%, far from our target of 60%. A recent World Bank study concluded that if all barriers against Malaysian women are removed and women’s participation in our economy is increased, the country’s income per capita could grow by 26.2%.</p> <p>90. Thirdly, Malaysia has become overly dependent on low-skilled labour, especially foreign workers. Cheap foreign labour disincentivises companies from investing in more productive capital and technology. As of end-2018, there were officially 2.2 million foreign workers, or 15% of the national labour force of 15 million people. We must reverse the addiction to low-skilled foreign labour, while recognising the many challenges industries face in securing adequate workforce for their industry.</p> <p>Strategy 5: Enhancing job opportunities for Malaysians</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>Malaysians@Work</p> <p>91. Recognising the key challenges we face, the Government will be launching the Malaysians@Work initiative, aimed at simultaneously creating better employment opportunities for youth and women and reducing our over-dependence on low-skilled foreign workers. Very simply, Malaysians@Work is divided into four programmes directed at providing both wage incentives for workers and hiring incentives for employers as follows:</p> <p>First: Graduates@Work is designed specifically for the hiring of</p> <p>graduates who have been unemployed for more than 12 months. The graduates who secures work will receive a wage incentive of RM500 per month, for a duration of two 2 years, while employers receive a hiring incentive up to RM300 per month for each new hire, for 2 years;</p> <p>Second: Women@Work seeks to create 33,000 job opportunities</p> <p>per year for women who have stopped working for a year or more, and are between 30-50 years-old. The wage incentive for returning women workers is RM500 per month for two years, and a corresponding hiring incentive for employers up to RM300 per month for 2 years. On top of the above, the current income tax exemption for women who return to work after a career break be extended for another 4 years until 2023;</p> <p>Third:</p> <p>Locals@Work is a hiring cost equalisation programme, aimed at incentivising the shift away from low-skilled foreign workers dependency. The wage incentive for Malaysians who are hired to replace foreign workers is at either RM350 or RM500 per month, depending on the sectors, for a duration of two 2 years, and corresponding hiring incentive for employers up to RM250 per month for 2 years; and</p> <p>Fourth: Apprentice@Work is a TVET incentive programme,</p> <p>aimed at encouraging more youth to enter TVET courses, in the form of additional RM100 per month on existing allowance for trainees on apprenticeships. The Government will also extend double tax deduction on expenses incurred by companies participating in Skim Latihan Dual Nasional (SLDN) for another two years. In addition, the double tax deduction currently given to companies undertaking Structured Internship Programme (SIP) approved by Talent Corporation Malaysia Berhad (TalentCorp) will be expanded to include students from all academic fields rather than just engineering and technology.</p> <p>92. The Government believes that Malaysians@Work programme will enable Malaysians who are unemployed to gain the necessary skill sets and capabilities with on-the-job training, to ensure continued employment with the relevant company, with the retention rate expected to exceed 90% after the incentive ends in two years. This will build human capital from the unemployed to become a self-reliant worker, able to contribute productively to the labour market.</p> <p>93. Other than the Apprentice@Work programme, the</p> <p>Malaysians@Work initiatives will be managed by the EPF, and will be subsequently integrated with the Employment Insurance System (EIS) as well as other active labour market programmes. The Government anticipates that the Malaysians@Work initiative will cost RM6.5 billion over five years and create an additional 350,000 jobs for Malaysians and reduce foreign workers dependency by more than 130,000.</p> <p>94. The Government will also be undertaking further measures to improve the working environment for women and parents in general. In year 2019, RM10 million was allocated for the development early childhood care facilities in government buildings. Through this, 66 new TASKAs were created in government facilities. The Government will allocate an additional RM30 million in 2020 to provide more TASKAs, focusing especially on hospitals and schools. In addition, to ease the financial burden of parents who enrol their children in registered nurseries and kindergartens, individual tax relief for fees paid will be increased from RM1,000 to RM2,000.</p> <p>Strategy 6: Modernising the Labour Market</p> <p>95. In addition to creating new employment opportunities, the Government will also continuously pursue efforts to modernise our labour market and enhance the employment conditions of workers.</p> <p>96. In order to remain relevant with the current needs of the labour market, the Government will review the Employment Act 1955, which includes the following:</p> <p>FIRST: In order to increase maternity leave from 60 days to 90</p> <p>days effective 2021,</p> <p>SECOND: Extend the eligibility to overtime from those earning less</p> <p>RM2,000 to those earning less than RM4,000 per month;</p> <p>THIRD: Improve protection and procedures for handling sexual</p> <p>harassment complaints, and;</p> <p>FOURTH: Introduce new provisions on the prohibition of</p> <p>discrimination on religion, ethnicity, and gender.</p> <p>97. The Pakatan Harapan Government is committed to improve livelihoods, particularly for lower income groups. The Government had increased the minimum wage to RM1,100 per month effective January 2019. In balancing the needs of employees and employers, the Government takes cognisance of the higher cost of living in major urban centres, the Government proposes to increase the minimum wage rate only in major cities to RM1,200 per month effective 2020.</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>Enhancing social protection</p> <p>98. With the ever changing work environment, the existing mechanism for social protection for workers will also need to be enhanced. In this regard:</p> <p>First: The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) will extend</p> <p>coverage to contract workers, for those under Contract for Services and Professionals. As a start, this will be a voluntary scheme for workers in the arts and entertainment industry via collaboration between EPF and the National Film Development Corporation Malaysia (FINAS) before extending the coverage to other sectors; and</p> <p>Second: The current Self-Employment Social Security Scheme by</p> <p>the Social Security Organisation (SOCSO) will be expanded to enable contributions by other selfemployed groups across 18 key sectors, such as fishermen, farmers, sole proprietors and partnerships.</p> <p>99. SOCSO will build a new RM500 million rehabilitation centre in Perak to mirror the success of the SOCSO Rehabilitation Centre in Melaka. The new centre will be equipped with the latest technology including robotics, trauma treatment and with a centre of excellence for prevention of accidents, in collaboration with relevant agencies.</p> <p> </p>\n",

      "<p>A KEY success factor for any entrepreneur is embracing lifelong learning to ensure business sustainability in changing times. That mindset was evident from the interest shown by the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) who tapped into the collective wisdom of experienced entrepreneurs at the recent SOBA LAB held in Menara Star, Petaling Jaya.</p> <p>There was much to glean from the story of electronics chain store Senheng Electric (KL) Sdn Bhd over the years.</p> <p>No stranger to turbulent times, its founder and managing director Lim Kim Heng shares the six transformations Senheng has undergone to stay competitive in the market.</p> <p>Among the most notable was its 2002 move to a fixed price model. Lim wanted to kickstart an aggressive expansion plan, but was limited due to the lack of talents skilled in price negotiation. He went against the current to launch fixed prices for Senheng’s products.</p> <p> </p><div class=\"embeded-image inline-image-center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/01CA5F77-C411-41C7-8B62-0152F0ED7FB9\" style=\"width: 350px; height: 334px;\"/></div> <p>The backlash was instantaneous, with business falling 25% in the first and second months, continuing well into its fifth month. To turn the tide, Lim introduced a loyalty card concept, which saw double digit sales growth for 11 years consecutively. </p> <p>“Before we launched fixed prices, there was no trust at all between customers and the shops. There’s no way to build trust if we’re both cheating each other, which was why I insisted on building loyalty to change the conversation from (purchasing products for) discounts to features,” he says.</p> <p>Along the way, he launched SenQ to target a different market. The shift to online shopping in 2014 also prompted further changes, as Senheng’s business dropped 6% to 7% for three consecutive years. </p> <p>Taking it in stride, he did his research and implemented several digital transformation initiatives, culminating in the 2017’s launch of a new retail concept he calls Seamless, which integrates its online and offline business, logistics and big data among others.</p> <p>The commonality among each transformation is Lim’s persistence in learning and adapting with the times.</p> <p> </p><div class=\"embeded-image inline-image-center\"><img alt=\"Growing responsibly: P’ng says giving handouts is not the way to do CSR right.\" src=\"https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/33E42E50-0305-4B2A-99B4-178F9F33375A\" style=\"width: 350px; height: 391px;\"/> <div class=\"inline-caption\">Growing responsibly: P’ng says giving handouts is not the way to do CSR right.  </div> </div> <p>Attendees also benefited from the expertise of Prof Muhaya Eye &amp; Lasik Centre Sdn Bhd chief executive officer Muhammad Addaem Mikhail Chandran, who spoke on the necessity of creating and executing a growth plan with a keen eye on financials.</p> <p>The key, he says, is managing priorities. The eye centre’s core pillar – like most other companies – lies in human resources. Thus, it is vital to put in place strong programmes for talent management and leadership development.</p> <p>“Numbers are important, but the organisation’s health is also important. A lot of companies fail because there is no sustainability in talents, so it’s something I pay a lot of attention to,” he says.</p> <p>Similar to Senheng’s Lim, Addaem also emphasises continuous learning, but adds that networking is also needed.</p> <p> </p><div class=\"embeded-image inline-image-center\"><img alt=\"Good partner: Azlina hopes to address SME pain points through its ecosystem.\" src=\"https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/E4FCC866-AB79-41DB-AC2E-5EEF9DB93B43\" style=\"width: 350px; height: 308px;\"/> <div class=\"inline-caption\">Good partner: Azlina hopes to address SME pain points through its ecosystem.  </div> </div> <p>For Hernan Corporation Sdn Bhd founder and chief executive officer Anna Teo, SMEs have to be proactive and approach relevant government agencies such as Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation (Matrade) to seek help.</p> <p>She briefly touched on the different local agencies that support SMEs with resources for growth and says, “Be proactive and approach government agencies to see how they can help you. Find out. Dare to ask. You won’t get anything being in your comfort zone or by not trying. Leverage the resources made available by these agencies.”</p> <p>That said, she cautions against complacency or taking such assistance for granted. When attending trade missions or trade exhibitions overseas, for instance, she advises SMEs to do their research, pre-arrange to meet buyers and set specific targets to achieve.</p> <p>“Make it worth it. Set targets and don’t come back empty handed.

Among these include its Anak Belajar Ibu Bekerja and Jom Bekerja Sambil Belajar programmes.</p> <p>The workshop also brought together industry experts to educate attendees on leveraging available resources in the SME support ecosystem for growth.</p> <p>Digi chief business officer Eugene Teh stresses the need for SMEs to find business partners for digital transformation.</p> <p>“We’ve reached a point in time where you can’t do everything on your own and you have to learn how to depend on partners that have the relevant expertise,” he shares.</p> <p> </p><div class=\"embeded-image inline-image-center\"><img alt=\"Take the initiative: Teo encourages SMEs to be proactive in seeking assistance.\" src=\"https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/BF994670-8AE1-4B41-8689-12D71E8EAD2A\" style=\"width: 350px; height: 257px;\"/> <div class=\"inline-caption\">Take the initiative: Teo encourages SMEs to be proactive in seeking assistance.  </div> </div> <p>Implementing small projects to ease a company into digitisation can quickly boost productivity and save costs.

      "<p>KUALA LUMPUR: SME Bank Malaysia Bhd, which is embarking on a two-year transformation programme, is targeting to approve RM3.5bil in financing to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) this year. </p> <p>Group president and CEO Aria Putera Ismail (pic) said the amount, which it is targeting to approve, is higher than last year’s figure of RM1.8bil. </p> <p>Since its establishment in 2005 until the end of 2018, SME Bank had assisted 17,000 SMEs in various sectors with financing of more than RM30bil.</p> <p>Despite some slowdown in the applications, the bank has rolled out various initiatives and conducted relevant engagements with SME entrepreneurs to ensure robust lending.</p> <p>“We have a role to play in the economy, as SMEs form close to 98% of the total business establishments in Malaysia. For example, through the Outreach Programme in 2018, SME Bank had approved financing of RM257.17mil. We have conducted this programme in 14 locations nationwide and met up with existing and new SMEs for possible opportunities to assist them in financing,” he said in an interview. </p> <p>In terms of SME financing, the biggest exposure was the services sector which formed 56% of total financing, followed by construction and manufacturing. </p> <p>On whether the bank was exercising stringent lending, Aria Putera said SME Bank was different from other commercial banks in that it has been mandated by the government to assist the unserved and underserved SMEs to obtain financing.</p> <p>Towards this end, he said the bank reviewed loan applications objectively. Business viability, market opportunity and compliance with financial terms and agreements were the criteria when approving loans.</p> <p>“The bank has been working with various agencies and our internal teams to assess, for example, which states needed genuine financing. It is not a one-size-fits-all type of approach,” Aria Putera noted.</p> <p>Among others, the bank provides various initiatives, one of which is via its subsidiary, Centre for Entrepreneur Development and Research (Cedar). The role of Cedar is to provide facilities beyond financing like training to entrepreneurs and holding roadshows to assist them. More than 38,000 participants have benefited from business coaching and training sessions conducted by Cedar.</p> <p>The lender also provides an “intervention role” to develop SMEs via a hand-holding approach from the entry point to inculcate business acumen among entrepreneurs, he said, adding that a total of 1,503 SMEs have successfully migrated to a higher level. </p> <p>These included expansion into the export market, improvement in technology and higher growth in profit.</p> <p>Via the Best Exporters Programme (BEP), it has helped SMEs to further boost their exports. As of December 2018, 73 companies had enrolled in the BEP and total export sales during the period stood at RM384.07mil. Twenty new exporters were created last year and 52 companies recorded incremental values in their export sales.</p> <p>According to Aria Putera, the bank adopts the Performance Measurement Framework, an initiative by Bank Negara aimed at ensuring that all development financial institutions would be measured on the outcome of their mandated role. This includes placing the focus on developing and implementing high-impact programmes for SMEs in targeted sectors in line with the mandate set by the government.</p> <p>SME Bank is also embarking on a two-year transformation programme. This is to enhance its role in providing financial assistance and capacity-building to assist the development of the SMEs. </p> <p>Describing the SME Bank digital transformation as a game-changer, he said it would revolve around implementing the digital transformation plan to revolutionise the way SME entrepreneurs are being supported and developed. </p> <p>“SME Bank’s digital transformation will be a part of the National SME Digital Platform, which will provide a clear demarcation on the targeted segments. It will create a greater synergy between agencies and avoid overlapping and be more focused towards the bank’s targeted segment. This will increase the income contribution of SME Bank from fee-based income by providing the above services,” he added. </p> <p>The National SME Digital Platform is targeted to be launched in the third quarter of this year.</p> <p>For the digital transformation programme, SME Bank is collaborating with its partners including Orion IXL, <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=TM\" target=\"_blank\">TELEKOM MALAYSIA BHD</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=TM\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a> and Commerce.Asia.</p> <p>On the SME Bank 90-Day Biz Challenge programme competition, Aria Putera said: “Collectively, the 20 finalists have garnered net sales of RM102,829.26 within just four months of the competition.</p> <p>“This is a good start, as the participants of this competition are still studying and are not able to operate the business on a full-time basis.”</p> <p>To further expand the reach of the competition, starting this year, the 90-Day Biz Challenge was opened to all polytechnic students throughout the country in addition to the community college students.</p> <p>The competition was organised through an online platform where participants have to submit their business plans through the www.YourSuccessOurStory.com portal. </p> <p>A total of 192 entries were received with the involvement of 768 students. </p> <p>This is an increase of 120% in participation compared with  2017.</p>\n",

      "<p>KUALA LUMPUR: The Islamic banking industry needs to explore ways to attract more deposits in the wake of stiff competition from institutional funds. </p> <p>Islamic banking veteran Datuk Badlisyah Abdul Ghani said Islamic banks were struggling to raise deposits from the consumer market.</p> <p>“A substantial amount of Islamic funds are now placed with institutional funds in the likes of Permodalan Nasional Bhd and Lembaga Tabung Haji. As a result, there is an ongoing struggle to attract funds into the Islamic banking space.</p> <p>“The big chunk of the deposits in Islamic banks are institutional deposits,’’ he told StarBiz.   </p> <p>Badlisyah, who is also the president of the Chartered Institute of Islamic Finance Professionals (CIIF), added that Islamic banks need to do more to attract funds and spur growth.  </p> <p>Although he expected growth in Islamics but it was still relatively small compared with conventional deposits.</p> <p>In the past, he noted that Islamic deposits had been growing by double-digit but now it was growing by a single-digit.  </p> <p>Badlisyah noted that it was a concern if one were to look at the asset size of both Islamic and conventional banking.</p> <p>For Islamic banking, with its total asset size of about RM917bil, it should be growing by at least a double-digit if not by triple-digit. This total asset size figure includes development financial institutions.</p> <p>But this is not the case, he said, noting that at the same time, this was merely an adjustment phase for the Islamic banking industry similar to other industries. </p> <p>On Islamic banking asset,  Badlisyah said it had been growing albeit at a moderate rate.</p> <p>He attributed it to, among others, the consolidation in the Islamic banking space and compliance of new rules required by the regulators. He viewed this as temporary and was confident banks would continue with their asset building exercise once they have sorted out the above issues.</p> <p>Meanwhile, RAM Ratings in its latest edition on Islamic banking said Islamic financing is still anchoring the growth of the overall Malaysian banking sector.</p> <p>It noted that Islamic banking continued to expand at a much faster pace than conventional loans in 2018, coming in at 11% (2017: 10.3%), in contrast to the latter’s 3.3% growth.</p> <p>As of end-January 2019, Islamic financing comprised some 32% of the overall system’s loans.</p> <p>The rating agency expected financing growth of the Islamic banking sector to stand at around 10% to 11% in 2019. </p> <p>As for the value-based intermediation (VBI) which is gaining momentum in Islamic finance,  Badlisyah noted that this practice was good for Islamic finance over the long term albeit some hiccups in the short term.</p> <p>He said banks would need, to be not only profit-centric but also socially-oriented. </p> <p>Over the long term, VBI would strengthen Islamic banking including earning prospects and outweigh costs. VBI is an intermediation function that aims to deliver the intended outcomes of syariah through practices, conduct and offerings that generate positive and sustainable impact to the economy, community and environment, consistent with the shareholders’ sustainable returns and long-term interests.</p> <p>The biggest challenge for Islamic banks Badlisyah said, is complacency. </p> <p>There is growth in the industry but only single-digit and more must be done to spur the industry.</p> <p>Although the Islamic banking industry has invested the best resources and infrastructure but there is still room for further growth, he stressed. </p> <p>“There must be self-reflection on the part of the industry as to what  needs to be done to further propel Islamic banking. This is the question which needs to addressed by the industry,” he said.</p> <p>As for the CIIF, which have about 1,000 members, Badlisyah said some time this month, the professional body would be introducing the Chartered Professionals in Islamic Finance.</p> <p>He said this would be a valuable qualification which would give a shot in the arm for  Islamic finance. </p> <p>CIIF is the only International Islamic Professional body in the world which is based in Malaysia.</p>\n",

About 83% of SMEs reported utilising information and communications technology (ICT) in their business operations, with 22% that have their own website and 14% that operate online stores.</p> <p>“More than half of the respondents (53%) used professional services including auditors, accountants or financial advisors to manage their financial accounts,” says the central bank.</p> <p>Despite the challenging business environment in the first quarter of 2018, the majority of SMEs (71%) recorded profit margins of above 10% and were able to maintain positive cash flows, says Bank Negara.</p> <p>“Manufacturing firms reported higher levels of productivity and paid higher wages for new graduate hires compared to other sectors.”</p> <p>On financing, the central bank says respondents reported utilising funds from a variety of sources, both internal and external, with own cash contributions being the main source.</p> <p>“Among other funding sources, about 27% of the respondents had facilities with financial institutions, followed by family and friends, internally-generated funds and micro-finance institutions.</p> <p>“In the micro-enterprise segment, 22% had financing facilities with financial institutions, including 9% of respondents who secured financing under the Pembiayaan Mikro facility.”</p> <p>Bank Negara says sources of financing also vary through the business life cycle.</p> <p>“At the initial stage, young firms tend to rely on their own cash and informal sources such as family and friends. This is consistent with most research findings, which attribute such behaviour typical of young firms to information opacity; lack of collateral, track record and financial skills; as well as high transactional costs.</p> <p>“As businesses mature (typically after five years in operation), they tend to rely more on external financing in the form of both debt and equity, including bank financing.”</p> <p>Among the SMEs that had applied for financing, most indicated that they were able to secure financing, says the central bank.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1240\" src=\"https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/3891908B-826C-4E6A-8C7A-EF390E883C56\" width=\"513\"/></p> <p>“About 22% of the respondents had applied for financing in the six months prior to the survey, with the majority (94%) of their applications being approved.”</p> <p>About 13% applied to financial institutions with 91% of their total financing applications approved, while the remaining 9% applied to other sources, with a 99% approval rate.</p> <p>Women-owned firms reported higher demand for financing (33% of women-owned firms applied versus 22% for all respondents), but experienced a lower approval rate of 83% (overall: 94%) mainly due to the lack of track record and insufficient documentation.</p> <p>“Most of these firms obtained unsecured financing from micro-finance institutions, banking institutions and development financial institutions,” Bank Negara says, adding that about 44% of the respondents were first-time borrowers.</p> <p>“The main purposes of the financing applications were for the purchase of assets (building, property, machinery and equipment: 23%), working capital (22%) and starting a new business (19%).”</p> <p>On average, the majority of the applications (89%) was approved within one month and the funds were disbursed within the subsequent month, says the central bank.</p> <p>The survey also provided insights on SMEs’ usage of other financial services, such as insurance, takaful and e-payments.</p> <p>“More than half of the respondents have insurance or takaful products, although this was less prevalent among micro-enterprises. </p> <p>“While the current take-up has been low, potential future demand for insurance and takaful by SMEs is significant for all products across the board, with emerging interest particularly in securing protection for risks associated with cyber security, professional indemnity, payment default and damages in crops.”</p> <p>The survey noted that SMEs mainly made electronic payments, but preferred cash in receiving payments from customers.</p> <p>“It was also observed that cheques remained popular for payments to suppliers and other business to business transactions.”</p> <p><strong>Underlying challenges in financing</strong></p> <p>With regards to challenges, the survey reveals that financing barriers mainly relate to documentation, costs and business viability.</p> <p>“Among the key constraints to business growth, difficulty in accessing sufficient financing was ranked low, second to last out of the nine constraints identified by SMEs,” says the central bank.</p> <p>It says SMEs that experienced rejections of their financing applications cited insufficient documentation, insufficient cash flow to meet repayments and non-viable business plans as the main reasons for rejection.</p> <p>“SMEs involved in automation, innovation, manufactures of goods, and exports experienced higher rejection rates compared to the overall SMEs. Firms that automated stated insufficient collateral and projects perceived to be of higher risk as key reasons for rejection.</p> <p>“The rejected applications were mainly for the purchase of machinery and equipment and ICT tools, as well as undertaking research and development.”</p> <p>Bank Negara says these projects could be deemed to be higher risk as they may involve moveable and intangible assets with low salvage value in the event of commercial failure and involve the use of new and untested processes with high uncertainty on returns.</p> <p>“Innovative firms cited insufficient documentation as a key factor for rejection. Exporting and manufacturing firms that faced greater difficulty obtaining financing were mainly firms that were newly established with limited repayment track records.</p> <p>“Businesses that needed financing but did not apply (41%) were either cautious in taking on debt, unsure of their repayment capacity, or found the application process too difficult.”</p> <p>The survey revealed that about 46% of the respondents stated that the financing products offered by financial institutions did not meet their business needs due to high financing costs (50%), insufficient financing amount (42%) and onerous documentation requirements (29%).</p> <p>“The average financing rate that respondents were willing to pay was 3.88%, well below the average lending rates to SMEs of 6.18% at the time of the survey (second quarter 2018).”</p> <p>The survey also indicated that the main constraints to SME growth were factors associated with operating and business conditions, namely increasing competition (69% of respondents), fluctuating demand (51%), rising input costs (44%) and rising labour costs (40%).</p>\n",

      "<p>PETALING JAYA: Institutionalising the new enhanced performance measurement framework for development financial institutions (DFIs) and ensuring its effective implementation will continue to be a key priority for DFIs and a focus of Bank Negara’s regulatory and supervisory activities.</p> <p>In parallel, the central bank is also engaging with the government to review the DFI landscape to take into account developments in the financial system and changes in Malaysia’s economic structure and priorities, Bank Negara said in its 2018 annual report.</p> <p>This seeks to provide a sharper focus in the mandates of DFIs while optimising performance and synergies.</p> <p>Efforts are also being pursued to enhance DFIs’ capability and capacity to deliver their mandates effectively. Specialised development finance programmes developed in collaboration with the Asian Institute of Chartered Bankers, the Iclif Leadership and Governance Centre and the World Bank were introduced.</p> <p>These complemented development-focused technical programme offerings that were led by the Association of Development Finance Institutions of Malaysia.</p> <p>In 2018, the central bank collaborated with the World Bank and DFIs to develop an enhanced performance measurement framework for DFIs. </p> <p>It aims to capture the broader contributions of DFIs by moving beyond the narrow focus of financing growth indicators, and integrating developmental key performance indicators to measure the socio-economic impact of DFIs’ operations.</p> <p>The framework also aims to encourage a stronger alignment between the performance of DFIs and their development impact. </p> <p>Further, in supporting the development of strategic and new growth sectors, the framework emphasises the need for DFIs to be financially sustainable, while minimising credit market distortions. </p> <p>The framework is being operationalised in phases and will continue to evolve as DFIs refine their KPIs to better reflect their mandates.</p> <p>Preliminary results of the measurement framework during the year suggest that the impact of DFIs extends well beyond providing the necessary financing to also include creating employment opportunities and upskilling targeted segments. </p> <p>Work continues to progress in building the necessary systems and capabilities within DFIs to effectively monitor and evaluate performance and development outcomes.</p>\n",

      "<p>IF we were to believe the hype whipped up by some politicians following the formation of the new government, the Malays in our country are in danger of losing everything.</p> <p>Planting fear and, using race and religion, has always been an effective emotional political weapon.</p> <p>Throw in threats of racial riots and soon, the temperature shoots up. It doesn’t help when counter arguments come in the form of equally distasteful racist remarks.</p> <p>These shenanigans usually only involve a handful of desperate politicians, likely the ones who lost in the general election, or are being investigated for corruption. Then there are some very loud co-operatives – presumably paid – who amplify their voices through social media.</p> <p>Only the ignorant would believe the incredible claims made up by these politicians.</p> <p>In Malaysia, almost all the institutions are dominated by Malays, including the civil service, police, army and the government. Just take a cursory look at the racial makeup of the Members of Parliament and senators at the Dewan Rakyat and Dewan Negara.</p> <p>Of the country’s 30 million-plus population, more than 60% are Malays, and those numbers will continue to grow while that of the Chinese and Indians keep shrinking.</p> <p>The Chinese population in Malaysia has consistently been declining from the early days of independence, from 37.6 % in 1957 to 24.6% in 2010, and 21.4% in 2015, due to a lower birth rate as well as a high level of emigration in recent decades.</p> <p>According to a news report in 2016, by 2030, the number of Chinese – the second largest ethnic group after the Malays – in Malaysia will drop to third place after the bumiputra and foreign migrant workers.</p> <p>A huge dip in the birth rate of the Chinese to 1.4 babies per family in 2015 from 7.4 in 1957 and a sharp rise in the numbers of foreign workers, are now threatening the Chinese’ position as the second largest grouping in Malaysia.</p> <p>The report, quoting projected data from the Department of Statistics, said the population percentage of local ethnic Chinese will shrink to 19.6% in 2030, from 24.6% in 2010 and 21.4% in 2015.</p> <p>The Chinese percentage is also projected to fall further to 18.9% in 2035.</p> <p>In the report, Chief Statistician Datuk Dr Hasan Abdul Rahman said that although the Chinese population will increase to 7.1 million people in 2040 from 6.6 million now, the percentage compared to the Malays and Indians might decline to 18.4% in 2040.</p> <p>In terms of numbers, the other two ethnic groups are projected to rise, with the bumiputra outdoing everyone else.</p> <p>The bumiputra population is anticipated to increase from 19.2 million in 2015 to 26 million by 2040, and Indians from two million to 2.3 million.</p> <p>The bumiputra population is anticipated to increase from 61.8% to 67.5%, and Indians from 5.5% to 6.4%.</p> <p>This huge Malay demographic simply means that the Malay electorate will be significantly broad.</p> <p>Looking at the country’s 1.6 million-strong civil service, Bernama reported in 2016 of then Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department Shahidan Kassim saying that as of December 2014, the ethnic composition of the civil service was as follows: 78.8% Malays, Bumiputera Sabah (6.1%), Bumiputera Sarawak (4.8 %), Chinese (5.2 %), Indians (4.1 %), Other Bumiputera (0.3%) and Others (0.7%).</p> <p>In the case of the powerful police force, then Home Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said in 2016 that the police needed more non-Malays to enlist as they currently make up only 5% of the 133,212-strong force.</p> <p>“Of the total, 80.23% (106,871) are Malays, while Chinese make up only 1.96% (2,615), Indians 3.16% (4,209), Punjabis 0.21% (275) and others 14.44% (19,242),” he told Parliament.</p> <p>The Malaysian Army, Royal Malaysian Navy and Royal Malaysian Air Force are also overwhelmingly populated by Malays. According to a news report, the Malaysian army comprises 98.3% Malays and 0.2% Chinese with officers making up 96.2%, out of which 1.4% are Chinese.</p> <p>That’s a far cry from the pre-independence days when the police, especially, had a decent number of Chinese, which was instrumental in our successful thwarting of the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) insurgents and urban terrorists.</p> <p>It was the infiltration of these Chinese policemen into the CPM, with the many dangerous and highly classified covert operations of the police Special Branch and military intelligence, which defeated the CPM.</p> <p>From the 1960s to the late 1970s, non-Malay armed forces personnel comprised about 30% of the total manpower while the navy and air force, excluding the army, had a higher percentage. Over the years, this figure gradually dropped to the current 5%.</p> <p>Certainly, no one is blaming the government for this situation since it has openly encouraged non-Malays to join.</p> <p>The responsibility of defending the country and the people should be shared by all Malaysians, so, it would be terribly unfair if this mammoth burden is only shouldered by the Malays. However, a combination of factors, including perceived low chances of promotion, has deterred many non-Malays from joining the ranks.</p> <p>Despite the tiny representation of the non-Malays in the services, especially the police, the men and women in uniform have performed professionally.</p> <p>Non-Malays feel secure and protected, even in the wake of incidents involving Malay attackers, and this must be remembered.</p> <p>And in the case of the economy, despite the large number of Chinese businessmen who continue to be listed among Malaysia’s richest, it has long been acknowledged that the Malays are now firmly in control of major banks, government-linked companies (GLCs) and top posts in the private sector.</p> <p>According to Prof Dr Terence Gomez, the GLCs hold sway over some RM1 trillion ($333 billion) worth of investments. According to his research, the seven GLCs control 35 of the top 100 listed companies in Malaysia, whose combined market capitalisation accounts for 42% of the market cap of all the listed companies on Bursa Malaysia.</p> <p>Many of these companies operate in key sectors of the economy, such as utilities, infrastructure, property and telecommunications. For example, some of MoF Inc’s key assets and investments include Petroliam Nasional Bhd, Khazanah Nasional, UDA Holdings Bhd, Keretapi Tanah Melayu Bhd, MRT Corp Sdn Bhd, Syarikat Prasarana Negara Bhd, SRC International Sdn Bhd as well as several development financial institutions. Khazanah Nasional’s investments include CIMB Group Bhd, UEM Group Bhd, PLUS Malaysia Bhd, Iskandar Investment Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd, TIME dotCom Bhd, IHH Healthcare Bhd, Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd, Malaysia Airports Holdings and Malaysia Airlines Bhd.</p> <p>But while these Malays, on the surface at least, seem to be enjoying power and high income from government-linked companies, many ordinary Malays in the rural and urban areas, sadly, still struggle daily.</p> <p>The years of affirmative action have created a broad base of the middle class, which is crucial and essential for a stable Malaysia, but many of the effects have not fully trickled down to the destitute.</p> <p>It’s these Malays who need help the most, and surely, they are the most deserving, too, but wealth has been plundered and looted by corrupt politicians who are now preaching the politics of hatred to their audience.</p> <p>Cut off from the access of rational and sound arguments in Bahasa Malaysia, the rhetoric of race and religion has found faithful listeners who buy into their bluff of Malays being threatened and in danger of losing their rights in the country, a privilege belonging to them solely, and no other Malaysians.</p> <p>Having a Finance Minister of Chinese ethnicity and an Attorney General of Indian origin are enough to trigger fears, never mind the fact that the government machinery is entirely Malay. And suddenly, ICRED has taken over 1MDB as the prime issue of the country.</p> <p>Never mind if their listeners can’t even pronounce the acronym and are largely clueless to what it’s all about, but for some reason, they seem convinced it takes away Malay rights and Islam.</p> <p>Politicians in this country, including those in power now, are no angels, although they would like to be viewed as the new breed of Malaysian politicians supposedly blind to race.</p> <p>Many have used the race and religion card themselves, even staging massive protests, but are now criticising the opposition for the same thing. It’s a classic case of the pot calling the kettle black.</p> <p>In some ways, some of our new ministers have also failed to handle the civil service well, given the crass way they have dealt with the more experienced and knowledgeable senior government officers.</p> <p>Instead of winning them over – as they, too, settle into the new political dynamic and culture – some inexperienced ministers, with their new-found power and authority, ignore their advice.</p> <p>Malaysia has been drained of copious amounts of money as a result of looting, so, we really have no time for any hysterics, as we need to get back to the economy race and lift our heads high again.</p>\n",

      "                KUALA LUMPUR: Household loan applications and approvals for the purchase of passenger cars grew by a monthly average of 27.7 per cent and 52 per cent, respectively, during the three-month tax holiday period ending August.<br/> <br/> Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) said the three-month moving average growth for the applications and approvals for such purchases increased from 24.8 per cent and 39.1 per cent, respectively, in July.<br/> <br/> The growth followed the zerorisation of the Goods and Services Tax rate effective June 1, it said in its Monthly Highlight August 2017 statement released today.<br/> <br/> The central bank said net financing growth continued to support the country’s economic activity, rising to 7.4 per cent last month from 7.2 per cent in July.<br/> <br/> Net financing refers to outstanding loans of the banking system (excluding development financial institutions) and outstanding corporate bonds.<br/> <br/> It said the outstanding banking system loan growth was sustained at 5.4 per cent (July: 5.3 per cent) while the outstanding corporate bond growth increased to 13.4 per cent (July: 13.0 per cent).<br/> <br/> The report also revealed that outstanding loan growth was stable for both businesses and households, each increasing by 0.1 percentage point to 3.8 per cent and 6.1 per cent, respectively, from the preceding month.<br/> <br/> Meanwhile, despite the ringgit’s depreciation by 1.1 per cent against the US dollar last month, the bond and equity markets improved amid continued support by domestic institutional investors.<br/> <br/> The FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI increased by two per cent during the month, driven mainly by positive earnings results in selected large-cap companies and higher global oil prices, BNM noted.<br/> <br/> The central bank attributed the ringgit’s weakening to non-resident portfolio outflows, of which the outflows were driven mainly by risk-off sentiments in the region on concerns over rising contagion risk, especially following the sharp fall in the Turkish lira.<br/> <br/> According to BNM, the banking system capitalisation remains strong.<br/> <br/> “Financial institutions are well-positioned to withstand severe macroeconomic and financial shocks, with excess capital buffers of RM146.1 billion as at August 2018,” it said.<br/> <br/> On the slight moderation in capital between July and August 2018, BNM said this was largely due to dividend payments and the gradual phasing out of Basel II capital instruments under the central bank’s Basel III transitional arrangements. - Bernama<br/> <div> </div>\n",

      "<p>DURING the GE14 campaign period, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad had famously referred to Malaysia’s complex ownership structure of government-linked companies (GLCs) as a “monster”. </p> <p>There was irony in this statement because Dr Mahathir, after all, had a played a leading role in crea­ting this structure that has enterpri­ses in every sector of the economy.</p> <p>However, he noted too that this structure was created to serve a “noble vision”, but the GLCs had evolved into tools exploited by politicians to serve their vested interests. </p> <p>There is undoubtedly a deep sense of frustration among Malay­sians, particularly business people, about the pervasiveness of GLCs in the economy. </p> <p>The contention is that the GLCs crowd out private firms in key economic segments, except the industrial and manufacturing sectors.</p> <p>Under Barisan Nasional, there had been numerous promises to reform the GLCs, particularly during economic crises.</p> <p>Critics also note that the presence of influential politicians in the GLCs has weakened managerial practices, undermining the performance of these firms. </p> <p>Through GLCs, corrupt politicians have channelled concessions to private companies in exchange for campaign contributions.</p> <p>Something must be urgently done about the GLCs. However, what is brewing as Malaysia embarks on an arduous journey of instituting reforms is a serious divide in opinion about how to deal with these GLCs.</p> <p>The most commonly articulated panacea is to privatise the GLCs. Unfortunately, it is not so simple. This debate assumes a homogenisation of GLCs when in fact there is a variety of such institutions that play different roles in the economy. </p> <p><strong>How we got here</strong></p> <p>The introduction of the New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1970 precipitated extensive government intervention in the economy. The NEP was a progressive 20-year affirmative action plan to eradicate poverty and equitably redistribute wealth between ethnic groups. Bumiputera corporate ownership then stood at a mere 1.5%. </p> <p>Government intervention entailed establishing public enterprises to acquire primarily foreign-owned businesses. These public enterprises, later renamed GLCs, were also introduced at the federal and state levels to play a developmental role in the economy.</p> <p>Among these GLCs were development financial institutions tasked with nurturing domestic SMEs, funding ventures in new sectors and promoting R&amp;D. </p> <p>Other GLCs included sectoral-based institutions to achieve core development goals and socioeconomic-type statutory bodies.</p> <p>After Dr Mahathir was first appointed Prime Minister in 1981, he embarked on privatisation,  par­tly to rid the government of the huge number of GLCs, but also to create a new breed of bumiputra entrepreneurs who owned business conglomerates of international repute.</p> <p>He achieved this goal but the 1997 Asian currency crisis unravelled his plans. </p> <p>The government had to renationalise many of these privatised companies, creating again a public sector that owned a large number of GLCs.</p> <p>A plan was initiated to reform GLCs, mainly those listed on the stock exchange. Professionals from the private sector were hired to manage them, while politicians were removed from their boards of directors.</p> <p>These professionals, most of whom had never served in government, were paid salaries benchmarked against private sector remuneration, an issue of much contention today. </p> <p>Another criticism was that these executives were subservient to the dictates of the Prime Minister. </p> <p>One outcome of this reform was that these GLCs emerged as leading firms. Since the turn of the century, GLCs have been among at least seven of Malaysia’s top 10 listed firms.</p> <p><strong>GLICs and listed GLCs</strong></p> <p>GLCs have, however, not evolved in a coherently linear direction. They are required to fulfil a range of business and social duties, implemented by different institutions.</p> <p>At the federal level, the GLCs are primarily owned by five savings- and investment-based institutions (the Employees Provident Fund, Retirement Fund (Inc), Lembaga Tabung Haji, Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera, and Permodalan Nasional Bhd), sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Bhd, and the government’s primary holding company, Minister of Finance Inc.</p> <p>Collectively termed as government-linked investment companies (GLICs), these seven vary considerably in size and objectives, and are ultimately controlled by the Finance Minister through a complex pyramid-type organisational structure.</p> <p>In early 2017, of the 900-odd companies listed on Bursa Malaysia, 70 were GLCs, that is, those with a GLIC as the largest shareholder. The 20 largest among these companies, known as the “G20”, accounted for about 42% of the exchange’s total market capitalisation.</p> <p>What is of concern is that the government has substantial equity interests – ranging from 5% to 37% – in 140 listed firms. However, the government is not the largest shareholder in these companies; instead, the majority owners are individuals or foreign enterprises.</p> <p>It is unclear why the government has sought to secure such huge shareholdings in these companies that it does not control. This sort of equity ownership could well be in order to earn dividends from the companies, but such shareholdings can lead to hostile takeovers.</p> <p>Business owners have long complained of expropriation of their companies by the government, ostensibly as part of its equity redistribution exercise. Fear of expropriation has undermined investor confidence and hampered R&amp;D endeavours to shape globally competitive enterprises.</p> <p><strong>Reforming the GLCs</strong></p> <p>Given the scale and scope of government involvement in the Malaysian economy, urgent reforms are necessary to ensure the GLCs function well and are taken out of the overwhelming control of politicians. There is no one remedy to deal with this colossal government-business complex. A thoughtful debate is imperative after a comprehensive study of these GLCs.</p> <p>In the short term, institutional reforms can be formulated to ensure accountable and transparent governance of the companies, specifically to address concentration of economic power in the Finance Ministry.</p> <p>Power has to be devolved to key oversight institutions such as Bank Negara, the Securities Commission and opposition-led parliamentary committees.</p> <p>Within GLCs, autonomous technocratic professionals must be employed, based on merit and not ethnicity, so that inefficiencies and abuse of power can be curbed. These professionals can be appointed by the Finance Minister, who will have jurisdiction over these GLCs, though subject to parliamentary oversight.</p> <p>In the long term, as part of the GLC reforms, there must be a review of how statutory bodies, holding companies and foundations function. The government should consider the implications of the restructuring on a sector-by-sector basis. The modes of reforms to be considered include divestment where government presence is not necessary, for example in construction, media and tourism.</p> <p>On the other hand, the government would need to retain ownership of GLCs in utilities, banking, oil and gas, defence, plantations, airport services and ports. </p> <p>The transfer of ownership of huge firms in these sectors to private investors may not serve the nation’s interest.</p> <p>However, in these cases, partial privatisation through the listing of the GLCs has been proposed as a way to raise funds while extending equity ownership to private investors. The government will retain control of these companies.</p> <p>While reforms are being debated, it must be considered that GLCs have played an important developmental role, creating a vibrant domestic privately-owned enterprise base, promoting mechanisms to encourage private firms to venture into new economic sectors, and enhancing the development of rural- and niche-based enterprises. GLCs must still play this role.</p> <p>Evidently, a number of issues must be reviewed when reforming this interlocking nexus of government and business. It is therefore surprising that the reform-minded Pakatan Harapan government has yet to act on this matter, even as debates about the GLCs gain  curency. </p> <p><strong>Edmund Terence Gomez is professor of political economy at the Faculty of Economics &amp; Administration, Universiti Malaya.

We have consolidated them under one fund to make it easy for SMEs as some funds were fully-utilised but some were under-utilised. </p><p>“Our rates are much cheaper (than that available in the industry), so we would advise those underserved segments to leverage on the fund,” she told a media briefing recently.</p><p>The revolving fund that is convenient and affordable for SMEs, was introduced in the late 90s with a total allocation of RM10.4bil.</p><p>Of the total, RM7.4bil has been utilised, with the lending approval revolved three times to the equivalent of RM30.2bil, benefiting more than 74,000 SMEs.</p><p>Chew said the fund, available at all commercial and Islamic banks, development financial institutions and Credit Guarantee Corp Malaysia Bhd, provided financial assistance of up to RM5mil and SMEs were required to repay within five years.</p><p>She explained that there was a comprehensive financing support for enterprises at all stages of their business life-cycle and that one out of five financing approvals were for start-ups.</p><p>“Financial institutions are the largest financing providers for SMEs, contributing about 97% of total financing to SMEs across the spectrum.</p><p>“Thirty per cent of the financing approved under the fund went to startups.</p><p>“The continuous support is reflected by the increasing share of SME financing compared with financing to the corporate sector. This indicates that SMEs are the key growth area for financial institutions, moving forward,” she added.</p><p>Chew pointed out that although ample funds were provided by financial institutions, ministries and agencies to support SMEs, the lack of awareness about the availability of such funds in the country was a challenge to SMEs’ future development and limited the segment’s contribution to the country’s gross domestic product.</p><p>“SMEs that are looking for financing, sometimes don’t know that there are such funds as the Bank Negara SME fund and some applications (for funding) may not be within banks’ risk appetite.</p><p>“But, (as for) our fund, there is still allocation for the SMEs to tap,” she added. – Bernama</p>\n",

      "<p>KUALA LUMPUR: Two weeks after the Securities Commission issued a stern warning to investors putting money into cryptocurrencies, Bank Negara has now said it will be issuing its guidelines on the issue by year-end. </p> <p>Bank Negara governor Tan Sri Muhammad Ibrahim has been looking into the matter and the details, as the new form of currency has attracted a lot of attention around the globe.</p> <p>“We hope to come out with guidelines on cryptocurrencies before the end of the year: in particular, those relating to anti-money laundering and terrorist financing. We want to ensure that there are clear guidelines for those who want to participate in this sector,” he said on the sidelines of the Global Symposium on Development Financial Institutions.</p> <p>The central bank last commented on cryptocurrencies more than three years ago when a statement was issued on Jan 2, 2014 saying that bitcoin was not recognised as legal tender in Malaysia, and that it did not regulate the operations of bitcoin.</p> <p>“The public is, therefore, advised to be cautious of the risks associated with the usage of such digital currency,” it had earlier said.</p> <p>China clamped down on bitcoin recently, with news wire reports saying that the second-biggest economy in the world had seen several large bitcoin exchanges closing down after the government there banned fundraising using the cryptocurrency.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Muhammad reiterated that the ringgit should always be reflective of Malaysia’s economic strength and fundamentals.</p> <p>“What is important is not so much the level of the ringgit, but that the ringgit must reflect the economic strength of Malaysia. If economic growth and inflation are under control, then the exchange rates should reflect that,” Muhammad said.</p> <p>He said a company’s competitiveness should not be solely derived from exchange rate weakness and should also be measured on other factors.</p> <p>“It is very important that the ringgit reflects our fundamentals. We have been very clear to the cooperations that they should not just rely on the exchange rate for competitiveness. They should (also) rely on productivity and innovation to sell to others and cannot just rely on exchange rates when marketing abroad,” Muhammad said.</p> <p>He also said the central bank was monitoring closely inflation levels, given the rising local petrol prices.</p> <p>“The inflation numbers that we saw in the last monetary policy committee meeting is still within projections. Inflation numbers are very much dependent on global oil prices, and so far, we do not expect this to increase at such a rate that would have implications on inflation rate projections, not yet,” he said.</p> <p>“But we are always keeping an open mind. As the data comes in, we will look at the implications on inflation and we will certainly disseminate this information as it comes in,” he added.</p> <p>He said that with economic growth being entrenched and inflation sitting within the expected range, it gives Bank Negara a little room for flexibility in terms of policy formation.</p> <p>“The next meeting is in early November and we will look at the data again to see where we should position the economy. It is very important that our interest rate levels must be at a level that would promote growth and ensure inflation is managed strongly,” Muhammad said.</p> <p>In his speech, Muhammad said properly structured development institutions could be a potent agent of change for private-sector investment, drive growth and forge inclusive societies. </p> <p>He said that more than ever today, development financial institutions needed to step up to promote new growth areas. </p> <p>“They should perform a broader role to stimulate economic activity that would not otherwise take place. They could also improve the quality and scale of such activities. They can provide unique value propositions in terms of advisory and nurturing new growth sectors to become profitable, and thus, attractive for private investors,” he said.</p> <p>He highlighted the rise of the Korean cultural phenomenon known as the Korean Wave or “Hallyu”, now a new growth area for the Korean economy, with the exports of culture content, including films and music, at an estimated value of US$83.2bil.</p> <p>“This extraordinary rise of the Korean Wave can be attributed to the growth of investment in the creative industry. The industry was boosted by the government’s strategy to prioritise the sector as an engine of growth after the Asian financial crisis,” he said.</p> <p>“The Korean government had earmarked 1% of the national budget for development financial institutions to kickstart the sector. Following their footsteps, domestic conglomerates like Samsung and Daewoo started investing in film financing and video production,” Muhammad added.</p> <p>He said this example showed that development financial institutions were the first to spearhead investments in the film and music industry. </p> <p>“At that time, commercial banks did not have the capability to assess the viability of the industry, nor accept the intangible assets offered as collateral. It was only much later, when the industry recorded healthy profits, that private investments followed,” he said.</p> <p>“The success speaks for itself. Between 2008 and 2011, private domestic and foreign investments in the culture content industry had quadrupled to more than US$157mil,” he added.</p>\n",

It will further reinforce the Government’s developmental agenda. It will provide a mechanism to address market failures. It will ensure that funds are allocated to the right sectors within the economy. <br/> <br/> \"Effectively done, it will increase the development financial institution’s credibility, reputation and potential as key players in advancing socio-economic development,\" he added.<br/> <br/> Muhammad also said development institutions should take the lead in providing solutions to stimulate investment and entrepreneurship.<br/> <br/> \"In my view, a key part of their contribution to development has to be in evolving non-traditional approaches to encourage investments in targeted sectors, precisely because conventional approaches have not responded adequately,\" he said.<br/> <br/> Finally, Muhammad said institutions can significantly increase their impact through resolving issues of corporate governance. <br/> <br/> \"The critical appraisal and monitoring functions are largely shaped by the strength of its corporate governance. These require competent and professional boards to be installed, clear rules of engagement with their stakeholders, and stronger performance management standards that are aligned with development outcomes.\"</p>\n",

infrastructure; and electricity, gas and water supply sectors.<br/> <br/> • In the FX market, the implementation of measures by the FMC in December led to improved onshore liquidity and curtailed the disruptive influence on ringgit volatility from speculative transactions in the ringgit NDF market.<br/> <br/> • Local currency settlements in ringgit and renminbi have continued to increase in volume, reducing costs for businesses and contributing to the development of deeper regional financial markets<br/> <br/> • Bank Negara set up the Financial Technology Enabler Group to provide a safe and supportive regulatory environment for financial technology (FinTech) innovations - it is tasked to formulate policy measures and strategies for the adoption of technological innovations in the financial services industry.<br/> <br/> <strong><strong>Payment and Settlement Systems</strong></strong><br/> <br/> • Amid the growing threat of cyberattacks globally, effective management of cyber risks was a key focus of Bank Negara’s oversight activities.<br/> <br/> • Progress continues to be made towards achieving the electronic payment (e-payment) targets set out in the Financial Sector Blueprint 2011–2020, driven by increased adoption of credit transfers and payment card transactions.<br/> <br/> • A key strategic priority for Bank Negara in 2017 will be to facilitate open and fair access to shared payment infrastructures by banks and non-bank payment service providers with the view to create a more competitive payment landscape that fosters continuous improvements in payment services.</p> </div>\n",

      "                KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's economy expanded at 4.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016, exceeding  economists' survey of 4.4%, underpinned by the manufacturing and services sector, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) said.<br/> <br/> The central bank said on Thursday, the Q4, 2016 economic growth, as measured by the gross domestic product (GDP), was flat when compared to a year ago. <br/> <br/> However, for 2016, the GDP grew at a slower pace of 4.2% when compared with the 5% expansion in 2015.<br/> <br/> “On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the economy recorded a sustained growth of 1.4% (3Q 2016: 1.4%),” it said.<br/> <br/> The 4.5% growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the 4.2% expansion in 2016 were within the range projected by Treasury.<br/> <br/> BNM said going forward, the global economy was expected to improve but remain on a moderate growth path.  <p>“While there are indications of more sustained growth in the major economies in 2017, downside risks to global growth continue to prevail, arising from the volatility in commodity prices, policy uncertainties and growth prospects of the major developed economies, heightened risk aversions in the global financial markets as well as geopolitical developments,” it said. <br/> <br/> BNM said while the external environment might continue to remain challenging, the Malaysian economy will experience sustained growth with the primary driver being domestic demand. <br/> <br/> “Private consumption is anticipated to remain supported by wage and employment growth, with additional impetus coming from announced government measures to support disposable income of households.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/23D6FCE1-9251-4F8A-951F-817DF4CA3F08\" style=\"height: 446px; width: 620px;\"/></p> <p> “Investment activity will continue to be anchored by the on-going implementation of infrastructure projects and capital spending in the manufacturing and services sectors,” it said.<br/> <br/> Commenting on BNM said the Q4 2016 growth was supported by the continued expansion in private sector expenditure. <br/> <br/> On the supply side, growth continued to be driven by the manufacturing and services sectors. <br/> <br/> “Overall, domestic demand expanded at a more moderate pace, as the improvement in private consumption and investment activity was more than offset by the decline in public expenditure. <br/> <br/> In the fourth quarter, private consumption grew by 6.2% (3Q 2016: 6.4%), supported by continued wage and employment growth. <br/> <br/> “Private investment registered a growth of 4.9% (3Q 2016: 4.7%), following continued capital spending in the services and manufacturing sectors. Growth of public investment improved mainly on account of higher spending on fixed assets by public corporation, but nevertheless, remained in contraction during the quarter. <br/> <br/> “Public consumption also declined by 4.2% (3Q 2016: +2.2%) arising from the rationalisation of spending on supplies and services and a moderation in the growth of spending on emoluments. <br/> <br/> “On the external front, net exports contributed positively to growth as real exports expanded at a faster rate than real imports. <br/> <br/> “On the supply side, growth in the manufacturing, mining and agriculture sectors improved,” BNM said. <br/> <br/> In the Q4 2016, the manufacturing sector expanded at a faster pace at 4.8% owing to higher growth in both domestic and export-oriented industries. <br/> <br/> The mining sector recorded an improvement of 4.9% due to the increase of natural gas production during the quarter. <br/> <br/> In the agriculture sector, economic activity contracted at a slower pace at -2.4%, reflecting the diminishing impact of El Niño on crude palm oil yields. <br/> <br/> Growth in the services sector continued to expand at 5.5%, albeit at a more moderate pace, supported mainly by consumption-related services. <br/> <br/> In the construction sector, growth remained driven by the civil engineering sub-sector, recording a growth of 5.1%.<br/> <br/> BNM said that in Q4, 2016, the current account surplus widened, due mainly to a higher trade surplus and narrower deficits in the income accounts.<br/> <br/> The central bank said as at Jan 31, 2017, the reserves position totalled US$95bil (RM426bil). The international reserves remain ample to facilitate international transactions. They are sufficient to finance 8.6 months of retained imports, significantly higher than the 3-month international threshold.<br/> <br/> Total gross financing raised by the private sector through the banking system, development financial institutions (DFIs), and the capital market amounted to RM316.2bil (3Q 2016: RM293.8bil). <br/> <br/> On the ringgit, BNM said it depreciated by 7.6% against the US dollar during the quarter. <br/> <br/> The ringgit also depreciated against the euro (-1.6%), the pound sterling (-2.4%) and the Australian dollar (-2.5%), but appreciated against the Japanese yen (6.3%). <br/> <br/> The ringgit also depreciated against all regional currencies, with the exception of the Korean won, by between 2.1% and 5.6%.<br/> <br/> BNM said the Malaysian financial system remains resilient despite global uncertainties over policy adjustments in the major economies. <br/> <br/> The domestic banking system remains well-capitalised, with ample liquidity to support the financing needs of businesses and households. <br/> <br/> As businesses and households continue to adjust to the challenging economic outlook and higher cost of living, these financial buffers will support the resilience of the financial institutions. <br/> <br/> It cautioned that going forward, external events will continue to weigh heavily on the volatility of the domestic financial markets. <br/> <br/> BNM said these include increased uncertainty over political developments and growth in the major economies as well as volatile commodity prices. <br/> <br/> “Domestic financial system stability is nonetheless expected to be preserved given the loss absorption capacity of financial institutions supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers”, it added.<br/>  </p> <div><br/> </div>\n",

      "                KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's banking system recorded a slight increase in outstanding business loan growth in December but a decline in loans to households, according to Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM).<br/> <br/> The central bank said on Tuesday outstanding business loans recorded an annual growth rate of 5% in December, slightly higher from the 4.6% in November.<br/> <br/> In its December monetary and financial developments statement issued on Tuesday, it said growth was driven by the on-year expansion of loans to most major sectors. <br/> <br/> These sectors included the wholesale and retail trade, restaurants and hotels; finance, insurance and business services; and transport, storage and communication sectors. <br/> <br/> However, for households, outstanding loans of the banking system grew at a slightly slower pace of 5.3% in December compared with 5.4% in November.<br/> <br/> “While the level of loan approvals for both businesses and households remained stable at RM29.3bil (November: RM29.9bil), the level of loan applications moderated slightly during the month.<br/> <br/> BNM said net financing to the private sector rose at a smaller annual pace of 5.5% in December (November: 6.7%). <br/> <br/> This was due to the moderation in the growth of net outstanding corporate bonds amid stable growth of loans extended by the banking system and development financial institutions (DFIs) during the month. <br/> <br/> The moderation in the growth of corporate bond issuances in December 2016 was mostly due to the higher base recorded in December 2015 given large one-off issuances by a few companies.<br/> <br/> As for broad money (M3), it recorded a stable annual growth of 3.0% in December (November: 2.9%). <br/> <br/> Underpinning the expansion in broad money continued to be driven mainly by the extension of credit to the private sector by the banking system. <br/> <br/> “The expansion, however, was partially offset by the continued growth of Islamic Investment Accounts, as reflected in other influences, and the decline in net foreign assets due to net capital outflows during the month,” it said.<br/> <div><br/> </div>\n",

      "<p>I AM hopping mad. My bank just told me that I have to pay a fee to have my ATM card replaced. No, I did not lose my card. No, I did not damage my card. It was actually in perfect working condition, but I have to replace it because the bank has to upgrade the security features.</p><p>Banks are making billions in profit and we poor consumers have to pay for them to upgrade their security. This is what I feared when banks started to migrate customers away from human tellers to machines. Once customers become used to machines, we become easy targets for whatever fees the banks deem fit to charge. We cannot feasibly go back to human tellers.</p><p>What happens if banks have to train their tellers on new security features and procedures? Do customers have to pay for these upgrades as well? We are already paying RM1 per transaction on interbank ATM withdrawals and another 6sen in GST.</p><p>The banking unions had long ago predicted that bank mergers into bigger banks would make banking more expensive for consumers.</p><p>I was already mad that another bank last year suddenly charged me RM10 a month just to maintain my flexible home loan account. It said it was providing services such as monthly statements which I did not request and do not need. My total interest cost over the full loan is already more than the loan amount.</p><p>It is therefore timely that the Ombudsman for Financial Services (OFS) commenced operations on Oct 1. The OFS is approved by Bank Negara under the Financial Services Act 2013 and Islamic Financial Services Act 2013 to provide a fair and efficient avenue for financial consumers to resolve disputes against financial service providers.</p><p>The OFS serves as an independent redress mechanism with minimum formality for financial consumers. It aims to strengthen the financial consumer protection framework.</p><p>Financial consumers can refer eligible disputes involving banks, insurance companies, takaful operators, development financial institutions, designated payment instrument issuers, insurance and takaful brokers and financial advisers to the OFS for resolution. Disputes filed must not exceed RM250,000. I hope disputes on banking charges can be referred as well.</p><p>The services of the OFS are offered free of charge to financial consumers. Unlike the Malaysian Aviation Commission (Mavcom) which was mulling a plan to charge departing passengers a fee ranging between RM1 and RM2, so that we would be paying for what is basically a consumer watchdog.</p><p>Last year, 83 million passengers passed through airports operated by Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB) and if Mavcom imposes a RM1 charge it can earn RM83mil per year.</p><p>I am already paying a lot for passenger service charges (PSC), up to RM65 per flight, miscellaneous charges, ancillary charges for usage of airline services, insurance, food and even a fee for using a credit card when such usage actually saves the airline money.</p><p>I do not have to pay a fee every time I make a retail purchase to keep the consumer tribunal running, do I? Nor do I pay a fee every time I use my mobile phone to keep the multimedia commission running.</p><p>At this rate, very soon I may have to pay a charge to keep the police and the judicial system running! Isn’t our GST supposed to help pay for all this?</p><p>To rub salt into the wound, Mavcom had been studying the proposals by MAHB to raise the PSC. So I am paying a fee to an organisation that may approve an increase in the PSC?</p><p>I am also very worried that the Government is going to approve increasing the PSC. I really believe that the PSC should be reduced, not increased. Why? Have you seen what has become of our airports these days?</p><p>Airports are originally designed for the convenience and safety of air travellers and offer a facility to allow people to board and depart an aircraft.</p><p>They have been converted into shopping centres with most of the space taken up by shops, leaving precious little room for weary travellers to even sit down.</p><p>Don’t believe me? Try finding a seat in our airports that is not part of the food and beverage outlets that you have to patronise. They even removed a walkalator at KLIA to make way for more shops. KLIA2 is more <em>pasar malam</em> than airport terminal, with hardly any space for travellers to push their luggage. The Kuching airport is not better with broken floor tiles, dysfunctional escalators and dirty toilets.</p><p>Hello, I don’t have to pay a service charge to patronise the shopping malls in the country! And they want to increase the PSC?</p>\n",

      "<p><strong>It is on rising trend, increasing 14% from three years ago</strong></p> <p>MENTION corporate fraud and most Malaysians will give a blank stare. An impromptu survey done by <em>StarBizWeek</em> in Kuala Lumpur’s central business district revealed the extent to which people know about corporate fraud. Of the 25 people, 23 did not know or did not want to comment.</p> <p>Experts say that corporate fraud is on the rise but that is difficult to ascertain since most research depends on survey respondents. Perhaps, the technology to detect such activities is better and the regulators have become more adept. But it is for sure that globalisation of economic activities and technology have also played a part in making fraudulent activities harder to detect or prosecute.</p> <p>Kroll Inc, the New York-based corporate investigations and risk consulting firm, says in a report that fraud is on an increasing trend, up 14% in its <em>Kroll Global Fraud Report 2015/2016</em>, from three years ago. The report noted that three-quarters of survey respondents were victims in the past year. The report also says that the number of companies weighed down in terms of financial loss arising from fraud has also increased to 69% last year, compared with 64% in 2014. </p> <p>An interesting observation among Malaysians is the equating of fraud with corruption. While its not exactly the same, there is often an element of corruption involved, as in people being paid off to turn the other way while fraudulent activity is being committed. Creative accounting is usually what comes to mind among people who have any opinion at all about corporate fraud. </p> <p>Vestra Solutions managing consultant and certified fraud examiner Gerald Pillai points out that developing countries such as Malaysia can see fraudulent activities rising, especially in economically challenging times while Baker Tilly Monteiro Heng corporate advisory partner Andrew Heng (<em>pic</em>) says corporate fraud is becoming more complex and has become increasingly difficult for auditors to detect. </p> <p>He adds that this is complicated by organisations forming shell companies abroad to create a semblance of legitimate business transactions. </p> <p>“You can create companies overseas and pretend to buy things from you on paper which could look normal, until you see the place and there is nothing there. </p> <p>“The level of detection and investigative work definitely will need to be increased, which will make it even harder for auditors to detect. It will not be something that you can instantly pick from the accounts,” Heng says.</p> <p>Obviously, any report on corporate fraud in Malaysia cannot ignore 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB), the controversial government-owned strategic investment firm. On July 20, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) announced a civil suit to seize more than US$1bil (RM4.02bil) in assets allegedly linked to 1MDB. </p> <p>Following the DOJ action, Deloitte Malaysia, 1MDB’s auditor, notified 1MDB of its intention to resign. Deloitte, referring to the suit, also noted that its audit reports for 1MDB’s financial statements for the financial years ended March 31, 2013 (FY13) and FY14 can no longer be relied upon because of information in the civil suit that were not available during those periods. 1MDB also sent out a statement saying that the audited financial statements for the periods concerned should no longer be relied on in light of the DOJ suit.</p> <p>Heng says the 1MDB case is not creative accounting per se but not having the right information on certain assets in certain companies that caused the auditors to withdraw their opinion. </p> <p>Referring to the 1MDB case, he says the role of auditors have become increasingly tougher and that there is need to give the client the benefit of doubt.</p> <p>However, in his experience, most corporate fraud involving listed companies here will have an element of creative accounting with the intention of manipulating the share price.</p> <p> The Transmile Group Bhd case from 2007 comes to mind. This case saw company officials abetting in making misleading statements relating to the airfreight company’s revenue in its unaudited consolidated results for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2006. Heng says there is sometimes, an element of money-laundering involved.</p> <p>Prominent fraud cases among listed companies in Malaysia in recent years include Kenmark Industrial Co (M) Bhd, Linear Corp Bhd and Axis Inc Bhd, all involving creative accounting. In Corporate Malaysia’s history, the Bumiputra Malaysia Finance Ltd (BMF) scandal of 1983 comes to mind as possibly the largest corporate scandal in the country then. </p> <p>The Hong Kong-based subsidiary of the-then Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd provided loans to several shady companies including units of Carrian Holdings Ltd, a conglomerate involved in property, finance and transportation.</p> <p> It involved the murder of a bank auditor and ultimately saw Hong Kong’s largest bankcruptcy with the collapse of Carrian. The Government also pumped in billions of ringgit to support Bank Bumiputra. </p> <p>Despite there being a royal commission of inquiry set up for this scandal, there were no prosecutions with BMF chairman Lorrain Esme Osman, living in exile until his death in London in 2011.</p> <p>Gerald says fraud needs to be prosecuted rigorously or it becomes part of the corporate culture. This sends a wrong message, he asserts.</p> <p>Given the number of prominent corporate scandals in the country in recent years, Gerald has this to say: “I think of late, we have this cover-up sort of attitude where we can always fix things and get away with it”.</p> <p>It is not to say that nothing is being done where fraud committed by listed companies is concerned. The Securities Commission in its annual report for 2015, shows that 74% of active investigations last year were devoted to insider trading, with the remainder for other misconducts such as corporate governance issues, fraud and market manipulation. </p> <p>However, experts say that there are still weaknesses in the active pursuit and prosecution of corporate fraud cases.</p> <p> They say that the laws are sufficient but enforcement is weak. </p> <p>The statutes that cover fraud and corruption in the country include the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009, the Penal Code, Development Financial Institutions Act 2002, Customs Act 1967 and the Election Offences Act 1954.</p> <p>“It probably comes down to enforcement whether relevant authorities understand these complications. </p> <p>“There is a corporate crime division in the police force and whether they want to beef up that division is important,” says Heng. </p> <p>Gerald stressed that the relevant authorities need to enforce the law without bias, only then can people consciously see that fraud is being taken seriously.</p> <p>Experts such as Heng say if bribery and corruption is lumped in with fraud, then the levels of fraud committed in Malaysia may be far higher.</p>\n",

It comprises M1, namely money in circulation and cash deposits in banks, as well as M2 of plus time, savings and foreign currency deposits. <br/> <br/> Net financing to the private sector registered an annual growth of 6.9% in June versus 7.2% in May, due to the moderation in growth of loans extended by the banking system and development financial institutions.<br/> <br/> The growth in outstanding business loans of the banking system was lower at 4.2% during the month from 4.5% in May, mainly due to the lower loan growth in the manufacturing, education and wholesale and retail trade, and restaurants and hotel sectors. <br/> <br/> Outstanding loans to households grew at a slower pace of 6.0% for the month under review as compared with 6.2% in May, reflecting continued moderation across most types of loans.<br/> <br/> “Overall loan demand, however, increased during the month with a higher level of loan applications from both businesses and households,” BNM said.<br/> <br/> Meanwhile, the central bank said the banking system maintained strong capitalisation with the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio, Tier 1 Capital Ratio and Total Capital Ratio at 12.9%, 13.9% and 16.4%, respectively. <br/> <br/> Net impaired loans accounted for 1.3% of net loans, while loan loss coverage ratio stood at 89.5%.<br/> <br/> As at July 15, BNM’s international reserves amounted to RM390.8bil (equivalent to US$97.3bil), which is sufficient to finance 8.2 months of retained imports and is 1.2 times the short-term external debt. - Bernama<br/> <div><br/> </div>\n",

      "<p><strong>Venture capital and equity crowdfunding are gaining more acceptance among small businesses as credit gets tighter and word spreads on the upside to these alternative sources of funding, writes JOY LEE. </strong></p> <p>WITH credit expected to get tighter this year as the economy slows, more and more small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are warming up to the idea of alternative financing.</p> <p>Secretariat for the Advancement of Malaysian Entrepreneurs (SAME) CEO Neil Foo noted that the awareness level on alternative funds among SMEs was increasing, resulting in more companies looking into such options. </p> <p>Small businesses have generally been hesitant to explore alternative financing, such as those offered by venture capitalists (VCs), as they require business owners to give up a portion of their stakes in return for funds. </p> <p>According to investors, VCs are looking at holding a minimum of 30-40% stake in companies that they are investing in. </p> <p>Foo said most were also concerned that these new investors might interfere in the daily operations and management of their business. This was not necessarily the case, he pointed out.</p> <p>“Investors with minority equity will mainly act more as a mentor for SMEs,” he assured.</p> <p>“They would be able to advise on marketing strategies, systems and can offer SMEs access to their networks.</p> <p>“SMEs are more open these days to alternative financing such as VCs, and more small businesses are becoming aware of this concept with the dissemination of information through financial roadshows, our talk programmes, as well as SAME VC programme,” he added.</p> <p>DOERS Knowledge Management Group Sdn Bhd business development director Ken Choo concurred, noting that SMEs were no longer just looking for money but were also seeking strategic investors who would be able to add value to the business. The right investors would certainly give the company a boost. </p> <p>Notably, the Government has acknowledged the importance of developing alternative funding for small businesses. The revised Budget 2016 saw a RM6bil increase in funding to state-owed development financial institution and venture capital funds to provide financing specifically to SMEs and startup companies.</p> <p>Although VCs tend to prefer investing in startups with high growth potential, Foo said they were also looking into other business sectors. </p> <p>“VCs are interested in high PE (price-earning ratio) for ICT companies such as apps businesses. But now, VCs are also expanding to other areas such as F&amp;B companies which can multiply with chain shops. Even housing developments are being considered now,” said Foo.</p> <p>Alternatively, SMEs can opt to apply for loans with development financial institutions like SME Bank and Credit Guarantee Corp (CGC), and more recently, equity crowdfunding platforms.</p> <p>The main problem for most SMEs in obtaining funds, however, is the lack of a convincing business proposal, according to Foo. </p> <p>SAME recently organised a business proposal seminar to address the challenges faced by SMEs in generating good business proposals and offered possible solutions to resolve their financial constraints. </p> <p>Some 150 participants had the opportunity to learn writing skills and techniques to ensure minimal rate of rejection when applying for loans. </p> <p>The panellists for the seminar included former director of development banking and liaison for SME Bank Asbullah Adnan, SAME advisor and UniPacific Corporate Services executive director and CEO Peter Phang, Propellar Crowd+ chief operating officer Bryan Chung, and DOERS’s Choo.</p> <p>Asbullah noted that statistics showed only 7% of proposals for loan get through. Proposals are rejected mainly due to non-compliance with guidelines and what is perceived to be projects that are not viable, among other things.</p> <p>For equity crowdfunding, Chung said it was important that a business proposal was positioned to address a need in the market. </p> <p>“The power of the funds is in the hands of the crowd. As long as you can convince the crowd, you can get the funds. </p> <p>“Your proposal has to be concise with relevant information. It has to be something that strikes a chord and not just mere compliance and standards,” said Chung.</p>\n",

      "<p><strong>DFIS, VCs to increase funding by RM6bil</strong></p> <p>Development financial institutions (DFIs) and government-owned venture capital funds (VCs) are expected to increase their funding by RM6bil. </p> <p>Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak said this would provide more financing to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and startup companies. </p> <p>The funding initiative was among the 11 restructuring measures and adjustments unveiled by the prime minister when he presented the recalibrated 2016 Budget. </p> <p>The measures are aimed at ensuring the country’s economy and financial position remain on the right trajectory, sustain economic growth and safeguard the well-being of the rakyat. </p> <p><strong>E-commerce poised for strong growth</strong></p> <p>The e-commerce market in Malaysia, excluding e-services, is poised for strong growth with a projected revenue of US$991.1mil this year.</p> <p>According to iPay88 executive director Chan Kok Long, even when the economy was not performing well, there would be growth in e-commerce and mobile commerce (m-commerce) for Malaysia in 2016.</p> <p>“The time is ripe for Malaysia whereby domestic market demand is well-supported by wide and stable online connectivity and broadband solutions,” he said.</p> <p>Additionally, he added, there were website provider services, IT security technologies, as well as ample government-led, financial payment policies and initiatives to support Malaysian companies move their businesses online.</p> <p>Chan noted that the weakening currency, plunging oil prices and retained interest rates had resulted in many companies across industries tightening their belts to weather the bad times. </p> <p>However, Chan noted that e-commerce offered many benefits.</p> <p>“Doing business online offers a lower cost of operations from many aspects, the biggest advantage being the capability to span geographical borders, meaning you can reach out to possibly more lucrative overseas market easily,” he said.</p> <p>However, Chan pointed out that only 5% of Malaysian companies have adopted e-commerce. </p> <p><strong>Govt to engage SMEs to enhance TPP participation</strong></p> <p>The Government is committed to enhancing the participation of SMEs to help them expand their business globally, particularly through the TPPA. </p> <p>International Trade and Industry Minister Datuk Seri Mustapa Mohamed said the Government would engage with SMEs to ensure they took advantage of the TPPA. </p> <p>“The government is aware that a lot more programmes could be introduced for SMEs, particularly those of Bumiputeras, so that they could join the global network,” he said. </p> <p>At present, SMEs’ contribution to the countrys export was 18%, he said, adding that government preferential policies on Bumiputera companies and government procurement would be maintained under the TPPA. </p> <p>On public anxiety over the TPPA, he said the Bumiputera affirmation policies under the Government Procurement Chapter, State-Owned Companies Chapter, Investment Chapter and Services Chapter would be continued. </p> <p>He said the flexibility granted to Malaysia include the duration and higher threshold in implementing the obligations, especially under the procurement chapter and state-owned companies chapter (SOEs) and designated monopolies. </p> <p>“This include allocating 30% (of government procurement) to Bumiputera contractors in the construction sector and an initial threshold of RM315mil.” </p> <p>He said the TPPA was not just a trade agreement, but also a transformation agenda towards transparent governance that would enhance the welfare of workers, management of the environment and standards compliance.</p> <p>Mustapa said five other countries had expressed their wish to joined the TPP and Malaysia would be lagging behind if it chose stay away from the trade pact. </p> <p>“Malaysia’s participation in the TPP will also show to the world that Malaysia is an open country that is willing to adhere to high international standards.”</p>\n",

      "<p><span style=\"font-weight: lighter;\">THERE was much concern for the people and investors on how Malaysia can weather the storm arising from the continuous plunging crude oil price that hovers around US$30 per barrel currently as Budget 2016 was drawn up based on estimated oil price of US$45 per barrel.</span></p> <p>The pressing question raised is whether our government can deal with the mammoth challenge to source for other revenue streams and to cut the expenditure to sufficiently plug the oil revenue gap so as to stay on course in meeting the fiscal deficit and national debt targets of 3.1% and 55% limit of gross domestic product (GDP) respectively, failing which the country’s sovereign rating may be downgraded, resulting in a whole host of ramifications. </p> <p>It is a relief to know that the government is committed to attaining the fiscal targets set and I am pleasantly surprised this can be achieved largely by the RM9bil cut in the development and operating expenditure. </p> <p>The cut is laudable as the budget’s operating expenditure had already been reduced by RM8bil when Budget 2016 was first prepared compared with Budget 2015. </p> <p>It is comforting to see greater discipline in public spending; in the past the grouses were that only the rakyat were required to tighten their belts. </p> <p>It seems the revenue gap that needed to be filled is not as wide judging from the mere RM9bil cut on public expenditure. </p> <p>This could be due to the unexpectedly high goods and services tax (GST) collection of RM51bil since its implementation on April 1 2015, the original forecast for the entire 2016 was only RM39bil. </p> <p>We must acknowledge the introduction of GST is absolutely timely to cushion the adversity facing the Malaysian economy. </p> <p>The Government’s economic transformation programme which also include subsidy rationalisation, diversification to the service sector, has reduced the country’s dependence on oil revenue from more than 40% of total revenue to 20% currently. </p> <p>It is heartening to note the government did not implement any measures which required the rakyat to fork out more money through income tax and a high in the GST rate.</p> <p>Doubling the compliance and auditing efforts on tax evaders and restructuring the selling channels in duty-free islands to plug leakages are continuous actions to ensure unscrupulous businesses are taxed.</p> <p>Measures that were anticipated but did not materialise included the full withdrawal of Labuan duty free status, further roll-back of tax incentives and hike in stamp duty rate. </p> <p>It is likely that such moves were not implemented as the priority of the government was to maintain a conducive and accommodative business environment to sustain the economy. </p> <p>The government is also providing a special tax relief of RM2,000 for individual taxpayers whose monthly salary did not exceed RM8,000 which will benefit two million taxpayers and cost the government RM350mil. </p> <p>The 3% reduction for employees’ contribution to the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) will increase market liquidity and purchasing power of consumers.</p> <p>The EPF cut would add RM8bil in disposable income to the country’s 13.8 million workforce and if the money is spent as investment or expenditure within our economy, it would boost our GDP of RM1.2 trillion by about 0.65%. </p> <p>The education and tourism sectors will benefit from the additional RM5bil allocation for study loans and the arrival of Chinese tourists without visa respectively. </p> <p>SMEs and start-ups would also benefit from the RM6bil fund injected by the development financial institutions and government-owned venture capital funds. </p> <p>Other effective measures the government may consider moving forward include optimising the government sizeable workforce which stands at 1.6mil now. </p> <p>Most of the commercial organisations locally and globally are embarking on right-sizing exercises to optimise resources utilisation and enhance competitiveness. </p> <p>Ultimately for an economy to thrive, the nation’s resources should be fully optimised. Land disposal can be a major revenue stream. In the case of Singapore government, it reaped about S$14bil in 2015 from the sale of land. </p> <p>We may fully adopt the public auction process practised by the Singapore and Hong Kong Governments. </p> <p>Generally, people are encouraged by the better than anticipated state of affairs of our fiscal position as well as the bold measures introduced especially on the RM9bil expenditure cut while more measures can be introduced to further consolidate and stimulate our economy. </p> <p><strong>Yee Wing Peng is the Country Tax Leader of Deloitte Malaysia.

      "<p><strong>Malaysia restrategises to deal with current economic challenges</strong></p> <p>THIS is a repeat of what happened to last year’s national budget. </p> <p>With global crude oil prices sliding to new multi-year lows, Malaysia - which derives a major portion of its revenue from petroleum sources - has been forced to revise its Budget 2016 just three months after tabling it in Parliament. </p> <p>And similar to what took place around the same time last year, policymakers, politicians, bankers, economists, business leaders, consumer advocates and journalists, had congregated at the Putrajaya International Convention Centre (PICC) over the week to listen to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak’s special address on how the Government is going to revise its strategies to weather the current economic challenges faced by the country.</p> <p>Did the recalibration of Budget 2016 meet expectations?</p> <p>Well, going by the reactions of economic stakeholders so far, it appeared opinions range from fairly muted to slightly positive.</p> <p>AllianceDBS Research chief economist Manokaran Mottain, for one, thinks it is the right move, at the right time.</p> <p>“The Government’s revised macro targets and revision measures look realistic and pro-growth,” Manokaran explains, noting that the review of Budget 2016 appears targeted at two key macro headwinds facing the country, that is, depressed crude oil prices that have weighing on the Government’s fiscal position and subdued private consumption that could strain economic growth.</p> <p>CIMB Research economist Maslynnawati Ahmad concurs, saying: “We view the recent budget recalibration positively, as it tries to balance the need to tighten spending and still be able to act counter-cyclically to prevent a sharper economic slowdown.” </p> <p>“The government realistically assumes a bigger shortfall to incorporate the need for relief measures for rakyat to support growth and did not again, for second consecutive year, attempt to cut back development expenditure as significantly as it always did in the past whenever faced with an unexpected revenue shortfall or increase in spending,” she explains. </p> <p>A banker with a local financial institution, on the other hand, says: “There is no ho-hum about it; we are in a no-choice situation, as the economic outlook has become dimmer.” </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: lighter;\">“New targets and assumptions, along with fresh stimulus measures, have to be set to be more reflective of the present environment. Importantly, we have to be prepared, as we will likely see even tougher times ahead,” the banker, who wants to remain anonymous, tell </span><em style=\"font-weight: lighter;\">StarBizWeek </em><span style=\"font-weight: lighter;\">on the sidelines after Najib’s special address at the PICC.</span></p> <p><strong>Dimmer outlook</strong></p> <p>Indeed, there are red flags in the economic horizon. </p> <p>Depressed crude oil prices, aside, we are also looking at potentially slower global economic growth this year, while world trade remains sluggish. </p> <p>Domestically, reports about people facing job cuts and retrenchments in certain industries, and businesses experiencing drastic drop in sales, are increasing.</p> <p>Three months ago, the Government still thought Malaysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) had the potential to grow up to 5% in 2016. </p> <p>But now, as highlighted in the recalibrated Budget 2016, the Government thinks Malaysia’s economic growth will unlikely exceed 4.5% this year. </p> <p>The country’s GDP, nevertheless, is still expected to expand by at least 4% this year.</p> <p>“The best policy strategy now is to focus on growth,” Manokaran argues, applauding the Government’s initiatives to spur private consumption, which accounts for more than 53% of the country’s GDP.</p> <p>Under the recalibrated Budget 2016, the Government has introduced several measures aimed at boosting household disposable income and alleviate the rising cost of living to support private consumption growth. </p> <p>These include allowing employees’ contributions to the Employee Provident Fund to be reduced by 3% from March 2016 to December 2017; granting a tax relief of RM2,000 to individual taxpayers earning RM8,000 or less a month for the 2015 year of assessment; and various initiatives to reduce cost of food and essential goods.</p> <p>“The key to support domestic demand is to boost private consumption by putting money into the pockets of consumers,” Bank Negara governor Tan Sri Zeti Akhtar Aziz explains, adding that domestic demand is expected to remain as pillar of growth for Malaysia’s economy amid the soft external environment.</p> <p>On whether Bank Negara would cut interest rates to boost the domestic economy, Zeti says, the prevailing overnight policy rate of 3.25% remains accommodative enough to support growth.</p> <p>“What’s more important for the country’s economy now is liquidity, and that’s why we have reduced the statutory reserve requirement (SRR),” she explains.</p> <p>The SRR, which is a requirement imposed on commercial banks to ensure that a portion of their funds are placed with the central bank, will be reduced from 4% to 3.5%, with effect from Feb 1. </p> <p>This measure is expected to inject RM6.1bil of liquidity into the banking system.</p> <p><strong>Weak sentiment</strong></p> <p>MIDF Research, meanwhile, thinks that although some of the new measures under the revised Budget 2016 could help cushion the economic slowdown, they may not be able to stimulate stronger economic activity, due to the critically weak consumer and business sentiment.</p> <p>As it is, consumer confidence in Malaysia has already hit a new low, given the poor outlook on the job market and income growth, while cost of living continues to increase.</p> <p>According to the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research (Mier), the consumer sentiment index (CSI) plunged to a record low of 63.8 points in the fourth quarter of last year. </p> <p>Notably, the CSI has been hovering below the 100-point threshold, which demarcates between optimism and pessimism, since the fourth quarter of 2014. </p> <p>Local businesses are also quite pessimistic about the current economic situation. </p> <p>While there is slight improvement in their sentiment, business condition index remains in the negative territory at 87.1 points in the fourth quarter of 2015.</p> <p>Analysts point out that there are not many new measures to directly address the needs of the private sector. </p> <p>The only notable one is the RM6bil increase in allocations by development financial institutions and government venture capital funds to benefit start-up companies.</p> <p>However, they reckon that there are already sufficient existing measures to support the private sector. </p> <p>Furthermore, they note, the recalibrated Budget 2016 is not a new budget, but remains in line with the initiatives and allocation that had been proposed when the original version was unveiled last October.</p> <p><strong>Fiscal discipline</strong></p> <p>The recalibrated Budget 2016 is based on two base-case scenarios: one with Brent crude, which is the international oil benchmark, averaging at US$30 (RM124.50) per barrel; the other with Brent crude averaging at US$35 per barrel. </p> <p>This compares with the average oil-price assumption of US$48 per barrel used for the original Budget 2016.</p> <p>According to secretary-general of Treasury Tan Sri Mohd Irwan Serigar Abdullah, Malaysia can withstand sustained oil price decline to US$25 per barrel. </p> <p>As long as oil prices remain above that level, the country will be able to sustain its economic growth and the recalibrated Budget 2016 will remain. </p> <p>But if oil prices were to go any lower than US$25 per barrel, Irwan reckons that there will be great challenges, not only for Malaysia, but also for the global economy.</p> <p>Brent crude was traded at around US$34 per barrel yesterday. Last week, prices of the commodity fell to a 13-year low of around US$28 per barrel.</p> <p>In line with the depressed oil prices, the recalibrated Budget 2016 projects the Government’s revenue to decline by 3.5%-4.2% to RM216.3bil-RM217.9bil, compared with the originally estimated RM225.7bil, while its total spending (operating and development expenditure) will be cut by 3.0%-3.6% to RM255.7bil-RM257.2bil from the initially proposed RM265.2bil.</p> <p>“Cuts to operating expenditures are positive in the medium term, in our view, given the relative difficulty in trimming this spending,” Nomura Research says. </p> <p>“We are also not overly concerned by cuts in the development spending budget – as we have argued, while Malaysia’s public capex disbursement rates are high relative to the rest of the region, it is usually less than 100%, with an average development spending disbursement rate of 92% between 2011 and 2014,” it adds.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Manokaran says, while the Government has been relatively silent on the specific operating and development expenditure it is targeting to slash, the commitment to achieve the 3.1% fiscal-deficit-to-GDP target should augur well for the country’s sovereign rating standings.</p> <p>“We believe that the credit rating agencies would be content to see this commitment,” he says. </p> <p>Looking ahead, though, Manokaran reckons that the fiscal challenge of balancing the budget by 2020 remains. </p> <p>“The Government will have to keep future budgets lean as the depressed crude oil price level could remain for a while,” he explains.</p>\n",

      "                KUALA LUMPUR: Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak delivered a revised Budget 2016 at Putrajaya International Convention Centre.<br/> <br/> Here is the full text of his speech:<br/> <br/> Ladies and Gentlemen,<br/> <br/> <strong>I. Introduction</strong><br/> <br/> 1. Alhamdulillahi Rabbil A'lamin wa biHi nastain. Blessings and peace be upon Prophet Muhammad SAW.<br/> <br/> 2. I begin by reciting the translation by the ulama with reference to the words of Allah Ta'ala in Surah Al-Insyirah that with each difficulty surely there is ease or happiness.<br/> <br/> 3. We should place such confidence in ourselves as well as in the administration and management of the Government.<br/> <br/> 4. As the old Malay saying goes, the coast changes with the tide. Thus, I wish to make a special address today as the 2016 Budget is also subject to challenges in the global economic environment.<br/> <br/> 5. Today, I wish to highlight and share with you an explanation, comparison and clarification as well as measures undertaken to address various challenges that the nation has and is experiencing for the last two decades.<br/> <br/> 6. We are grateful to Allah SWT for among those present today are leaders and administrators, civil servants, captains of industry, corporate figures, representatives from foreign missions, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and volunteers.<br/> <br/> 7. All are here today for this special address to understand the Government's action in recalibrating and restructuring several economic measures, particularly with regard to the 2016 Budget.<br/> <br/> 8. Of importance, the recalibration and restructuring of the Budget are centred on two main pillars. First, to ensure the economy remains on a strong growth trajectory, and second, to protect and safeguard the welfare and well-being of the rakyat.<br/> <br/> 9. In tandem with the People First concept, the measures that I will announce soon is a comprehensive summary after taking into account ideas and views that I have received.<br/> <br/> 10. This was complemented by several engagement sessions with various economic stakeholders including Government-linked companies (GLCs), economists as well as industry experts.<br/> <br/> 11. The Government has also received excellent ideas from various levels of NGOs, representing consumers, esteemed businessmen and directors of commercial banks.<br/> <br/> 12. The majority of them are here with us this afternoon. Thank you for your input.<br/> <br/> Indeed, we are all doing this together for our nation.<br/> <br/> <strong>II. Comparison of the Economic Scenario Since 1997/1998</strong><br/> <br/> 13. First, let us reflect on the economic scenario during the Asian financial crisis from 1997 to 1998.<br/> <br/> 14. In 1997/1998, the country experienced an economic recession with GDP recording a negative growth of 7.4%.<br/> <br/> 15. We should not forget that among the significant effects of the recession were the sharp retrenchments; increase in inflation; reduction in international reserves to RM59 billion; and the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) index plummeting to reach 260-point level.<br/> <br/> 16. Many companies went bust. Furthermore, some of our children including Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) school leavers and young graduates had their dreams and aspirations to continue their studies abroad crushed as the Government then could not afford to finance them.<br/> <br/> 17. Given the situation, the leadership of the Government then took drastic measures including implementing capital controls and currency pegging the ringgit at 3.80 to the US dollar.<br/> <br/> 18. Banking institutions were rationalised and private sector loans were restructured through the establishment of Danaharta and Danamodal. The Government also implemented a stimulus package of RM7 billion to revive the domestic economy.<br/> <br/> 19. The nation again faced an economic recession in 2008/2009 due to the subprime crisis in the US which impacted the global economy as well as the steep increase in global crude oil prices reaching USD130 per barrel compared with an average of USD70 per barrel in 2007.<br/> <br/> 20. The country's exports declined by more than 15%. This affected consumer and business sentiments.<br/> <br/> 21. During that time, I had just been appointed as the Minister of Finance and without hesitation took immediate measures by announcing the first economic stimulus package amounting to RM7 billion in November 2008.<br/> <br/> 22. A few months later, a second stimulus package of RM60 billion was undertaken in March 2009 to continue to stimulate domestic economic activity. The second stimulus package also involved initiatives and collaboration between the Government and the private sector.<br/> <br/> 23. In addition to the stimulus packages, upon assuming the nation's leadership and until today, the Government planned and implemented several initiatives under the National Transformation Policy (NTP).<br/> <br/> 24. The Government launched the Government Transformation Programme (GTP) and the Economic Transformation Programme (ETP) to elevate Malaysia to a developed and high-income country by 2020.<br/> <br/> 25. Among the achievements of the transformation include strong GDP growth averaging 5.6%; reduction in Government fiscal deficit from 6.7% to 3.2% as well as manageable inflation rate.<br/> <br/> 26. We are grateful that hardcore poverty has almost been eradicated. In addition, 1.8 million job opportunities were created and rakyat 1Malaysia initiatives and programmes were introduced such as 1Malaysia People Assistance (Bantuan Rakyat 1Malaysia or BR1M), 1Malaysia Book Voucher (Baucar Buku 1Malaysia or BB1M), Kedai Rakyat 1Malaysia (KR1M), Klinik 1Malaysia and affordable housing.<br/> <br/> 27. Life is not always smooth sailing. Looking back at the scenario in 2015, Malaysia faced several daunting challenges that were unexpected and beyond our control.<br/> <br/> 28. Crude oil prices declined from USD100 in 2014 to USD48 per barrel in 2015. Crude oil prices have since continued to fall resulting in the recalibration of the 2015 Budget.<br/> <br/> 29. Last year, the country's oil-related revenue fell by almost RM14 billion. Thus, on 20 January 2015, on behalf of the Government, I presented the recalibration of the 2015 Budget by rationalising government expenditure as well as revising the fiscal deficit target from 3% to 3.2% to GDP.<br/> <br/> 30. I would like to emphasise that the recalibration of the 2015 Budget was supported by initiatives such as the rationalisation of fuel subsidy which was implemented earlier although it was an unpopular decision.<br/> <br/> 31. All praise is due to Allah, these measures have been successful in mitigating the impact from declining oil prices and global economic uncertainties.<br/> <br/> 32. Indeed, international rating agencies such as Moody's, Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch remain confident in the nation's strong economic fundamentals and financial position by maintaining a good credit rating.<br/> <br/> 33. Based on these factors, I am confident that the economy will record a growth of 5% and the fiscal deficit at 3.2% of GDP as targeted for 2015. The GDP growth for 2015 will be announced next month.<br/> <br/> <strong>III. Latest Economic Scenario</strong><br/> <br/> 34. The global economy is expected to be more challenging in 2016. The latest data by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) indicates that the global economy will grow at a slower pace from 3.6% to 3.4%.<br/> <br/> 35. Meanwhile, world trade is anticipated to moderate from 4.1% to 3.4%. This is on account of several economies such as South Africa, the US, Brazil and China which are also expected to grow at a slower pace.<br/> <br/> 36. This trend proves that we are not alone in facing the global economic challenges. Other countries too are affected by the current economic uncertainties.<br/> <br/> 37. World crude oil prices have continued to plummet below USD30 per barrel. As of yesterday, Dated Brent crude oil prices dropped to USD31 per barrel, a reduction of 35% compared to the assumption of USD48 during the tabling of the 2016 Budget.<br/> <br/> 38. These developments have a significant effect on the nation's revenue. The economy of oil producing countries has also been adversely affected.<br/> <br/> 39. Furthermore, the US dollar continues to strengthen compared to other currencies. Among the currencies affected are the Brazil real (-23.2%), China renminbi (-5.7%), Canadian dollar (-11.3%), Russian ruble (-29.3%), and Singapore dollar (-5.6%).<br/> <br/> 40. Meanwhile, the ringgit too has depreciated by 11.3% against the US dollar from 3.77 in June 2015 to 4.25 on 27 January 2016.<br/> <br/> 41. In fact, the ringgit is undervalued and does not reflect the true economic fundamentals. However, the ringgit is expected to better reflect the strength of the economic fundamentals when global financial markets stabilise and oil prices recover to more reasonable levels.<br/> <br/> <strong>IV. New Measures</strong><br/> <br/> 42. These developments have increased uncertainties in the global economy and impacted the domestic economy as well as resulted in the rising cost of living of the rakyat.<br/> <br/> 43. Recognising this, and as a responsible Head of the Government together with the Deputy Prime Minister and Cabinet Ministers, today, we are taking proactive action to announce the implementation of measures under the recalibrated 2016 Budget.<br/> <br/> 44. These initiatives are very important to ensure sustainable economic growth, and more importantly, to safeguard the wellbeing of the rakyat. I am confident that together we can overcome these difficult challenges again.<br/> <br/> We have done it before, God willing, we can do it again.<br/> <br/> 45. Similar to the situation last year, I wish to reiterate that the nation is neither in economic nor technical recession.<br/> <br/> 46. In fact, with our efforts and prayers, the domestic economy continues to remain strong and resilient, capable of facing global economic uncertainties.<br/> <br/> 47. In addition to the measures in the 2016 Budget, I am pleased to announce 11 restructured and recalibrated measures to ensure the economy and financial position remain on the right trajectory.<br/> <br/> 48. Measure 1: The Government agrees to reduce the employees' contribution to the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) by 3% beginning March 2016 to December 2017. However, the contribution by employers will remain. This measure is expected to increase private consumption expenditure by RM8 billion a year.<br/> <br/> 49. Measure 2: The Government will provide a special tax relief of RM2,000 to individual taxpayers with a monthly income of RM8,000 or below for the year of assessment 2015.<br/> <br/> Through this measure, although the Government will forego revenue of RM350 million, it will provide individual tax savings of up to RM475 which will benefit two million taxpayers.<br/> <br/> 50. Measure 3: To reduce the cost of daily basic necessities for the rakyat, the Government will implement the following:<br/> <br/> i. The Government will liberalise the control on import quotas or Approved Permits (APs) on eight agricultural produce for a temporary period to ensure consistent supply.<br/> <br/> The produce includes raw coffee beans, buffalo meat, beef and mutton. At the same time, quality and safety requirements on imported goods will continue to be given priority;<br/> <br/> ii. Federal Agricultural Marketing Authority (FAMA) will establish markets or MyFarm Outlets that sell agricultural produce directly such as fish, poultry, meat, vegetables and fruits at prices between 5% and 20% below market prices. For a start, the first outlet will be opened in Precinct 7, Putrajaya in March and expanded nationwide to 10 other locations in town centres this year;<br/> <br/> iii. To ensure that the rakyat enjoy fair prices of goods, I have directed the Ministry of Domestic Trade, Co-operatives and Consumerism (MDTCC) to identify more fair price shops including foreign and local hypermarkets. Thus, fair price shops will be increased from 640 to 1,000 shops this year;<br/> <br/> iv. At the same time, MDTCC will step up enforcement and take legal action on non-ethical businessmen who take the opportunity of profiteering;<br/> <br/> v. To safeguard the paddy farmers as well as to increase paddy production, the Government will provide an additional cash of RM50 for every metric tonne of cleaned paddy as an input incentive for paddy production. At the same time, the Government will improve the implementation of paddy grading through a standard grading system; and<br/> <br/> vi. The Government is very concerned for the rakyat who are affected by the increase in the cost of living, particularly the hardcore poor. Thus, MyBeras programme will be introduced where every registered hardcore poor household will be supplied with 20 kilogrammes of rice every month until December 2016 to reduce the burden of poor households.<br/> <br/> 51. Measure 4: With immediate effect, for all new housing projects, the Government mandates that all houses priced up to RM300,000 be limited to first-time house buyers only.<br/> <br/> The Government will also organise Integrated House Ownership Expo Roadshows which offer houses under the National Housing Department (JPN), 1Malaysia People Housing Programme (PR1MA), Syarikat Perumahan Negara Berhad (SPNB), Perumahan Penjawat Awam 1Malaysia (PPA1M) and state agencies as well as the private sector. More than 100,000 housing units will be offered under the programme.<br/> <br/> In addition, for houses priced at RM35,000 under the People's Housing Programme (Projek Perumahan Rakyat or PPR), I am pleased to announce that the Government through Bank Simpanan Nasional (BSN) and Bank Rakyat will offer a financing package at 4% involving a fund totalling RM400 million. This initiative will benefit more than 10,000 house owners.<br/> <br/> 52. Measure 5: As announced in the 2016 Budget, 30% from the levy contribution to the Human Resources Development Fund (HRDF) amounting to RM200 million will be provided to enhance the competency and skills of employees through reskilling and upskilling, including retrenched workers.<br/> <br/> 53. Measure 6: To enhance the efficiency and amount of tax collection, the following measures will be implemented:<br/> <br/> i. The Government will double compliance and auditing efforts on tax evaders;<br/> <br/> ii. The Government to give special consideration on relaxation for penalty on taxpayers to encourage them to come forward and declare their past years' income. The tax arrears must be settled before 31 December 2016;<br/> <br/> iii. For duty-free islands, to reduce leakages which resulted in revenue loss of nearly RM1 billion, the Government will restructure the selling channel of cigarettes and liquors limited to duty-free outlets licensed by the Royal Malaysian Customs Department (RMCD);<br/> <br/> iv. The free duty treatment on imported vehicles in duty-free islands will be tightened.<br/> <br/> However, the restructuring of sales on cigarettes, liquors and vehicles will not affect the tourists and locals who are residing in these duty-free islands;<br/> <br/> v. The Government will optimise the revenue from the telecommunication spectrum through a redistribution and bidding process which will be implemented soon; and<br/> <br/> vi. To invigorate economic activity, the Government will develop several strategic areas owned by the Government through a bidding process.<br/> <br/> 54. Measure 7: Under the initiative of the Deputy Prime Minister, as the Chair of the Foreign Workers Committee, the Government will streamline the management of the foreign workers system whereby the levy will be clustered into two categories only. This does not include the foreign domestic maid category.<br/> <br/> In addition, the Government has agreed to implement the Rehiring Programme to provide opportunities for Foreign Workers Without Permits (PATI) in the country to be given valid work permits. The implementation of this programme is to fulfil industry demand as well as to enable the Government to ascertain the number of PATI in the country for the purpose of security monitoring.<br/> <br/> 55. Measure 8: The Government will be more prudent in spending, particularly on supplies and services; continue efforts to rationalise the provision of grants to Government Trust Funds, federal statutory bodies and GLCs; as well as rationalise and restructure entities, including Companies Limited By Guarantee (CLBG) and statutory bodies.<br/> <br/> 56. Measure 9: With regard to development expenditure, focus will be given to projects and programmes that are rakyat-centric, as well as with high multiplier effect and low import content.<br/> <br/> Physical projects that will be prioritised include construction of affordable houses, hospitals, schools, roads and public transport as well as security. The implementation of non-physical projects and projects that are still under study will be rescheduled. This measure is expected to involve a reduction in cash flow commitments up to RM5 billion and does not affect the economy and the rakyat.<br/> <br/> 57. Measure 10: Development financial institutions (DFIs) and Government-owned venture capital funds (VCs) will increase their financing funds by RM6 billion to provide financing to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and startup companies.<br/> <br/> 58. Measure 11: I urge the GLCs to implement the initiative to narrow the income gap between higher management and employees gradually. The private sector is also urged to implement the same initiative. This will be monitored by the Economic Planning Unit (EPU).<br/> <br/> 59. More focus will be given to the tourism sector as the increase in tourist arrivals will stimulate domestic economic growth, particularly in the current economic scenario. The promotion of domestic tourism will be intensified through organising sales of integrated domestic holiday packages.<br/> <br/> 60. In addition, the Government will facilitate the entry of foreign tourists by expediting the implementation of eVisa to several countries which have been identified.<br/> <br/> 61. As an additional measure, I am pleased to announce that tourists from China do not require a visa to visit Malaysia or Visa Free, commencing from 1 March to 31 December 2016, subject to specific conditions for a period of stay not exceeding 15 days.<br/> <br/> 62. Although the global economic situation and the decline in crude oil prices have an impact on the nation's revenue which is estimated to fall by RM7 to RM9 billion compared to the estimated revenue with crude oil price at USD48 per barrel, the Government will not compromise on doing the right thing for the nation and the rakyat.<br/> <br/> 63. BR1M and welfare assistance programmes will continue to be implemented. I would also like to emphasise that the Government will maintain the current rate of the Goods and Services Tax (GST).<br/> <br/> 64. The Government will continue to spend prudently by prioritising projects and programmes with high impact centred on the philosophy of the people economy.<br/> <br/> 65. This will not involve the emoluments of civil servants and pensions of retirees as well as not affect the delivery mechanism of the Government. In fact, the Government will not terminate the services of any civil servants, including those appointed on contract basis.<br/> <br/> Furthermore, the Government will continue the implementation of one annual increment for civil servants on 1 July 2016, as promised in the 2016 Budget.<br/> <br/> 66. These prudent measures are expected to save RM9 billion in operating expenditure and development expenditure.<br/> <br/> 67. Regardless of what happens, the Government assures it is committed in the education and future of our children. In this regard, the Government agrees to continue four programmes under the sponsorship of the Public Service Department (PSD) for 2016 as follows:<br/> <br/> First, the National Scholarship Programme for 20 top SPM students to pursue study at renowned universities globally.<br/> <br/> Second, the Special Engineering Programme for 200 students to Japan, Korea, Germany and France.<br/> <br/> Third, the Bursary Graduate Programme for 744 students to pursue undergraduate studies in public universities and private institutions of higher learning in the country; and<br/> <br/> Fourth, the new intake of 8,000 students will be awarded scholarships to pursue undergraduate studies in the country.<br/> <br/> 68. Furthermore, the allocation for the National Higher Education Fund (PTPTN) financing totalling RM5 billion will continue to be channelled to undergraduates.<br/> <br/> 69. To intensify investment in human capital, the MyBrain15, Academic Training Scheme for Bumiputera (SLAB) and Academic Training Scheme of Public Higher Education Institutions (SLAI) programmes will be continued.<br/> <br/> 70. Currently, 25,000 students are pursuing studies under these programmes. The Government has agreed to the increase of 15,000 new students for the MyMaster programme, 5,000 for MyPhD, and 300 for SLAI. These programmes will be given an additional allocation of RM300 million.<br/> <br/> 71. I wish to emphasise that:<br/> <br/> First: After taking into consideration the current economic scenario, the Government has decided to revise the 2016 forecast of GDP growth to 4% – 4.5% and the assumption for average Dated Brent crude oil price at USD30 to 35 per barrel;<br/> <br/> Second: The Government is committed to fiscal consolidation measures for 2016, that is, to achieve a fiscal deficit target of 3.1% to GDP;<br/> <br/> Third: The national debt level will continue to be reduced and will not exceed the prudent level of 55% to GDP;<br/> <br/> Fourth: The Government will neither impose capital control nor peg the ringgit;<br/> <br/> Fifth: Maintain an accommodative monetary policy and interest rate at a level that supports domestic economic activity; and<br/> <br/> Sixth: Ensure sufficient liquidity in the financial system. Recently, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) announced a reduction in statutory reserve requirement (SRR) from 4% to 3.5%.<br/> <br/> 72. Clearly, the Government will not waiver from its stance on fiscal and monetary policies to ensure the strength of the economy.<br/> <br/> 73. The Government is also concerned over the lifestyle of the rakyat who live beyond their means. In this regard, the Credit Counselling and Debt Management Agency (AKPK) under BNM will assist borrowers with difficulties in managing their debt obligations through restructuring their existing loans. The good news is that all these services are provided free.<br/> <br/> 74. For viable SMEs and companies that face financial problems due to the current environment, the Government provides a negotiation mechanism through the Small Debt Resolution Scheme and the Corporate Debt Restructuring Committee under BNM.<br/> <br/> 75. In terms of investment, I wish to emphasise that the Government remains committed to achieving the targeted private investment totalling RM215 billion this year.<br/> <br/> 76. For example, the implementation of major projects such as Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) and Light Railway Transit (LRT), Pan-Borneo Highway, Malaysian Vision Valley, Cyber City Centre, RAPID Pengerang and High-Speed Rail will be continued.<br/> <br/> 77. To enhance strategic linkages between urban and rural areas, the Government will build another 10 Urban Transformation Centres (UTCs) in Labuan, Sungai Petani, Miri, Sibu, Kota Bharu, Kuala Terengganu, Tawau, Keningau, Seremban and Kangar.<br/> <br/> 78. In addition, four new Rural Transformation Centres (RTCs) are expected to be completed this year in Jawi, Pulau Pinang; Rembau, Negeri Sembilan; Sungai Rambai, Melaka; and Betong, Sarawak.<br/> <br/> 79. To penetrate international markets, MATRADE and SME Corp will intensify the mid-tier and Go-Export programmes. In addition, to enhance the credit guarantee facility for trade, EXIM Bank will increase its funds for financing by RM500 million.<br/> <br/> 80. As a trading nation with an open economy, the Government will expand exports to other markets. We have to explore new markets through participation in free trade agreements (FTAs) such as the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA) as well as the upcoming Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).<br/> <br/> 81. With regard to the TPPA which was passed by Dewan Rakyat late yesterday, the allegation by some quarters that we have compromised national sovereignty and were apologetic in defending the Bumiputera agenda during the negotiations with TPPA members were unfounded.<br/> <br/> 82. It is noteworthy that the Government's efforts and firmness during the negotiation process with the members of the TPPA have resulted in the acceptance of the Bumiputera policy as part of the terms of the Agreement at the international level.<br/> <br/> 83. Thus the Bumiputera Agenda is no longer a national agenda, but has now been elevated and recognised globally.<br/> <br/> <strong>V. Conclusion</strong><br/> <br/> 84. An advanced nation is not solely due to good and appropriate policies but also the contribution from all segments of society.<br/> <br/> 85. We all have a shared responsibility irrespective of the private sector, Government, NGO, youth and women, and regardless of whether one is a chief executive officer, director, support staff, worker or a small sundry shop owner.<br/> <br/> 86. Overall, the five key salient points are summarised as follows:<br/> <br/> First: The recalibrated measures announced are proactive, transparent and realistic in tandem with the current global economic challenges;<br/> <br/> Second: The economy remains resilient and continues to expand driven by domestic economic activity;<br/> <br/> Third: The wellbeing of the rakyat will continue to be prioritised and Government service delivery will not be compromised;<br/> <br/> Fourth: The Government is committed to implementing the fiscal consolidation measures; and<br/> <br/> Fifth: The recalibration of the budget is centred on the principle of shared responsibility from all segments of society.<br/> <br/> 87. In brief, the restructuring and recalibration of the 2016 Budget is similar to last year. It is not a new budget. It is within the range of initiatives and allocation of the 2016 Budget approved by Parliament.<br/> <br/> 88. It is clear that matters related to the nation's economy and finance is not easy to digest and understood by all levels.<br/> <br/> 89. In fact, these issues are not solely the responsibility of the nation's administration at the highest level.<br/> <br/> 90. Borrowing the words of wisdom from the learned ones, in life and livelihood, in a country with a government, everyone must play his part, helping each other through thick and thin. That is our source of strength.<br/> <br/> 91. Hence, I hope that every segment plays its part in explaining the current economic situation and initiatives of the Government to further strengthen the economy as well as safeguard the wellbeing of the rakyat.<br/> <br/> 92. This means that all groups from the Government administration to the learned ones need to explain in greater detail the current situation and challenges to all parties from top to bottom, engaging in discussions in mamak stalls over teh tarik to the best of their abilities.<br/> <br/> 93. With that, we hope our great grandchildren will recognise all our achievements for Malaysia's continuity which is not our right but the right of the future generation.<br/> <br/> 94. We hold to the saying of the elders: it is better to be silent rather than speak empty words and to give voice to useful matters. Do not ask what the nation has done for you but ask what we have done for the nation.<br/> <br/> 95. In essence, the challenges confronting us currently are not due to the failure of the Government to plan, but are on account of the global economic crisis which is beyond our control.<br/> <br/> 96. Indeed, every decision that we make today is the best for the rakyat and will surely be recorded in history. Furthermore, Malaysia is neither a failed state nor a bankrupt nation as alleged.<br/> <br/> 97. In fact, the reality is the economy is stable with strong growth as well as resilient and competitive.<br/> <br/> 98. Let us together pray to the Almighty to overcome all problems and enjoy security, peace and harmony.<br/> <br/> Thank you.\n",

      "                KUALA LUMPUR: Credit Guarantee Corp Malaysia Bhd (CGC) and the Business Development Fund (BDF) of Rwanda has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to collaborate on the development of credit guarantee framework for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Rwanda. <br/> <br/> With the signing of the MoU, CGC shall offer assistance and guidance to BDF to develop, design and review the credit guarantee framework to support the development of SMEs in Rwanda. <br/> <br/> CGC will also be providing technical assistance in the development of the credit guarantee schemes, policy guidelines and other operational matters, it said in a statement issued following the signing ceremony in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday. <br/> <br/> CGC president and chief executive officer Mohd Zamree Mohd Ishak said the collaboration between CGC and BDF would enable CGC to share its 43 years of experience and expertise in SME financing and overall SME development in Rwanda.<br/> <br/> Mohd Zamree said that the collaboration would also enable CGC to share and transfer its knowledge and experience to BDF through on-the-job trainings, research, publications and study visits. <br/> <br/> CGC regularly host study visits for the development financial institutions from Asia, the Middle East and Africa. <br/> <br/> In 2015, CGC hosted study visits from the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI) that had 41 delegates from 33 countries and also delegations from Bangladesh, Egypt, Japan and South Korea. <br/> <br/> “Many developing countries that do not have credit guarantee institutions are observing CGC as a model and success story and want to emulate it in introducing the guarantee mechanism in their respective countries. <br/> <br/> “This is not just an acknowledgement of CGC’s expertise but also of Malaysia’s capabilities in SME development,” Mohd Zamree said. <br/> <br/> CGC has been at the forefront of SME development not only in Malaysia but also at international level, assisting countries such as Papua New Guinea, Mongolia, Timor Leste and other countries in the Middle East and Africa. <br/> <br/> “Rwanda and Malaysia share a long and warm friendship. Today, we are taking another step to further strengthen the relations. The MOU marks a milestone in formalising a partnership not only between BDF and CGC, but also between both countries,” BDF Rwanda chief executive officer Innocent Bulindi said. <br/> <br/> “The Government of Rwanda has recently enhanced BDFs mandate to support SMEs. In this regard, BDF is undergoing a transformation to strengthen its capacities, especially in developing the right skill set and expertise to deliver its new mandate. <br/> <br/> “It is indeed an honour for BDF to have the opportunity to learn from CGC’s experiences, strategies and successes which have been accumulated over time in such a high calibre institution,” he said. <br/> <br/> Since its inception in 1972, CGC has given financing to SMEs valued over RM56bil, benefitting about 315,000 SMEs. - Bernama<br/> <div><br/> </div>\n",

      "<p><strong>Lim Wing Hooi reports on a forum to educate SMEs about the ins and outs of applying for bank loans.</strong></p> <p>ACCESS TO financing has always been vital for the smooth running of companies and the economy. </p> <p>With that in mind, the Secretariat for the Advancement of Malaysian Entrepreneurs (SAME) organised a closed-door forum to discuss how to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) prepare themselves before knocking on the banker’s door.</p> <p>As part of its effort to help Malaysian SMEs, SAME organises such forums to educate SMEs about the issues they face.</p> <p>The eighth forum, titled “Winning bank loans with a business plan”, was moderated by SAME chief executive officer Neil Foo at the organisation’s office in Menara Usahawan, Putrajaya on May 27.</p> <p>Teoh Eng Tat, entrepreneur development manager for the Centre for Entrepreneur Development and Research (Cedar) and one of two panelists present at the forum, explained the fundamentals of credit assessment.</p> <p>Teoh elaborated on the 5Cs of credit assessment: Character of the borrower, the Capacity of the business to generate funds to repay, the initial Capital that the entrepeneur put at risk, the current Condition involving the operating business environment and lastly, the Collateral offered to the bank.</p> <p>“This is the typical criterias that bankers look at. For new companies, a business plan that (addresses all these factors) is deemed bankable and bankers will move on to the next level of checks, which may involve going for site visits,” Teoh said.</p> <p>Cedar, a subsidiary of SME Bank is also a training, consultancy and research centre aimed at building the capacity of both the SMEs and the employees of development finance institutions (DFIs), which include microfinance institutions, community development financial institutions and revolving loan funds .</p> <p>Another panelist, Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Malaysia (ACCCIM) SME commitee chairman and national council member Koong Lin Loong said it is vital to bridge the gap of expectations between the entrepreneurs and the bankers.</p> <p>“Entrepreneurs expect bankers to give them bigger loans whereas bankers expect borrowers to provide more documents to justify their loan application,” Koong said.</p> <p>Elaborating further, he said bankers should understand what he called the 4Ms and how entrepreneurs function.</p> <p>“They are Money, Manpower, Marketing and Management. In the last M, the entrepreneur has to manage all the 3Ms of money, manpower and marketing,” he said.</p> <p>Koong said, as a result of the gap in expectations, surveys conducted by ACCCIM show that 80% of new entrepreneurs rely on funds from their own savings, friends or family members.</p> <p>“Some even go to Ah Longs (loan sharks). On the other hand, some also use their credit cards to draw cash advances, despite the higher interest rate and upfront fees, simply because the automated teller machine will not ask you for a business proposal or other 5C criteria,” he said.</p> <p>Teoh feels that entrepreneurs should try to address the doubts of bankers via their business plan and be clear about what their business is.</p> <p>“We have across entrepreneurs who do not know that their financial background will be checked, and some have no idea how big a loan they really need. The worst is they try to start a business just because they see a trend and try to follow,” Teoh said.</p> <p>Koong added that another document that bankers will look at is financial statements.</p> <p>“If these do not show that the business can make money, that there is no cash flow, how is the entrepreneur going to repay the bank?” he asked.</p> <p>Having said that, there are genuine entrepreneurs who needs financing and understanding the issue, the forum concluded that banks should emulate what Cedar is doing by providing training to entrepreneurs.</p> <p>Koong said banks have the resources to pool their expertise, particularly in investment banking to put up analysis on various industries that SMEs are in to help their SME lending units make better decisions. This would also include training the SMEs to better prepare themselves.</p> <p>Teoh added this is something that is similar to what Cedar is doing. The organisation currently has a team of 30 people, ranging from former entrepreneurs to professionals with knowledge in accounting, law and human resources. Teoh said they plan to increase the staff strength to 48 by end of the year.</p> <p>“It is in the bank’s interest because when we prepare entrepreneurs for loan applications, we are also helping them to refine their business proposals and mindset. In the long run, this helps reduce the bank’s number of non-performing loans,” he said.</p>\n",

Industry observers note that the loans would certainly ease the financial burdens faced by SMEs as it widens the financing channels available to these businesses.</p> <p>Wee had said the MCA was inundated with phone calls asking about the loans.</p> <p>“Every place we visit, business people keep asking us, where can we borrow money?” he said.</p> <p>The scheme will be managed by Kojadi, MCA’s education and investment arm. The loans come with an interest rate of 4% – more competitive compared to loans provided by most other financial institutions – and would be a feasible solution for most SMEs, said Wee.</p> <p>He added that borrowers could take loans up to a maximum of five years.</p> <p>“This revolving fund will add to the large range of financial services aimed at helping SMEs,” he said, adding that SMEs would no longer have to rely on loan sharks to expand their businesses.</p> <p>The loan is open to Malaysian citizens aged 21 to 60. Applicants are required to be a member of Kojadi, with initial shares and membership entrance fees set at RM110. Applicants will also have to make a RM500 non-refundable payment of loan processing fee and administration fee, to be submitted with the application.</p> <p>Applications are expected to take seven working days upon full submission of documents.</p> <p>The loans can be used for working capital, expenditure and project financing, among other things. Businesses that have been operating for less than three years with a minimum turnover of RM200,000 a year would be considered for the loan.</p> <p>“This would indeed have a good impact on Chinese SMEs, and we are working to get the word out so that these businesses can take advantage of the loans,” said Neil Foo, CEO of Secretariat for the Advancement of Malaysian Entrepreneurs. </p> <p>“There are also other commercial banks and development financial institutions that have been set up by the government to aid SMEs. They have been around for many years. But there is an information gap whereby the businesses are not aware of these loans. So we want to get the word out,” he added.</p> <p>Repayment of the loan will be made on a monthly basis, and payment can be made directly at Kojadi’s office or to any designated Kojadi accounts with the banks.</p> <p>Application form for the loan can be downloaded from the MCA or Kojadi official website at <a href=\"http://www.mca.org.my\">www.mca.org.my</a> or http://<a href=\"http://kojadi.my\">kojadi.my</a>.</p> <p><br/> </p>\n",

It offers professional certificate programmes in Malaysia’s financial marketplace.<br/> <br/> “It will address the peculiar needs of the development financial institutions (DFIs) fraternity and offers a new pathway for the trainees in tandem with the existing chartered banker and chartered Islamic banker paths,” he said.<br/> <br/> The collaboration between SME-CEDAR and IBFIM will cover training in the area of development and delivery of Islamic banking and finance programmes for SME Bank staff and existing and potential clients.<br/> <br/> “SME Bank is ready to help produce more talents in its efforts to deliver the desired professional services in compliance with syariah law,” Radzif said.<br/> <br/> <strong>Middle East banks tighten SME credit</strong><br/> <br/> Banks in the Gulf states are tightening lending conditions for small, private companies as the region copes with declining oil prices.<br/> <br/> As it stands, lending to SMEs make up a very small amount of banks’ business. According to a World Bank study, SMEs accounted for only about 2% of GCC banks’ loans in 2010 as they typically rely more on non-bank financial companies.<br/> <br/> However, SMEs account for much of the job creation in the Gulf, reportedly employing over 40% of the workforce in Dubai, and this could affect the business community at large in the longer run.<br/> <br/> Bankers are apparently becoming more cautious about lending to SMEs because they fear low oil prices could deprive the companies of access to fresh business.<br/> <br/> Additionally, a global US regulatory crackdown on money laundering has increased the compliance costs for banks doing SME business, as banks have to spend more resources on checking their clients’ legitimacy.<br/> <br/> “We are seeing the SME sector under stress more often – sometimes a result of changes in commodity prices and sometimes liquidity-related, which may be due to some well-publicised exits from this market,” said a senior banker handling loan portfolios at a UAE bank.<br/> <br/> “Regional banks, as a result, are monitoring their exposures more intensely.”</p>\n",

      "<p><strong>Bank Negara’s subsidiary says SMEs need to get their papers in order while financiers ought to highlight SME schemes, reports JOY LEE.</strong></p><p>Access to finance has been a long-standing issue among small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Most small businesses complain that there is a lack of funding available to SMEs as they are, by and large, shunned by financial institutions.</p><p>However, Credit Guarantee Corp Malaysia Bhd (CGC) assistant vice president of branch performance department Hon Chee Yoong begs to differ.</p><p>“Personally, I think it is just a lack of communication between financiers and the SMEs. They don’t know what the banks’ criteria and risk appetite are. Different banks have different policies and assessments.</p><p>“SMEs should take the initiative to find out about these criteria, and financial institutions should put in more effort to educate the SMEs on the products that are available to them,” Hon points out at a recent forum entitled “SME Financial Resources”.</p><p>The forum was organised by the Secretariat for the Advancement of Malaysian Entrepreneurs (SAME) at its office last week and was moderated by chief executive officer Neil Foo. The other panellist is SAME advisor Peter Phang.</p><p>Hon explains that there are also development financial institutions, such as CGC, which enables SMEs to obtain funding.</p><p>CGC, a subsidiary of Bank Negara Malaysia, facilitates SMEs’ access to financing through direct financing schemes, as well as its guarantee schemes, particularly for those without collateral or track record.</p><p>He notes that its guarantee scheme is particularly attractive to SMEs, given that they do not require any collateral for their loans. To date, CGC has guaranteed close to RM56bil.</p><p>“Almost every bank has a CGC scheme, and SMEs have the right to ask about this scheme,” Hon says.</p><p>Businesses can also obtain loans from CGC itself. CGC has a 70% approval rate for its direct financing products. Most times, Hon says, applicants fail to secure loans due to a lack of proper documentation.</p><p>“Small businesses tend to have issues with keeping proper records, mostly because some are small enough not to qualify for auditing. But they need to do their paperwork and keep their files. It makes it easier to get their loans approved,” he says.</p><p>Phang adds that SME applicants need to ensure that they have a functional business plan and proper financial records or estimates in order to secure their loans.</p><p>“Financial institutions are particular about the company, the phase it is in, the nature of the business, its products and credibility,” he notes.</p><p>Phang admits that financing for SMEs in Malaysia is not as vibrant as that in other fully liberalised markets like Hong Kong. </p><p>Due to the competitive market in Hong Kong, Phang explains, there is a wider range of financial products available at competitive rates over there.</p><p>“It is easier to get financing in markets like Hong Kong but it is a different type of market. Here, we are doing what we can to close the gap between small businesses and financiers. There are loans available.</p><p>“The thing is, the information about these loans is not so easily available, particularly to businesses outside of the Klang Valley. The laymen don’t know that they actually have a lot of choices for financing,” says Phang, who was previously a director of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council at the Malaysia office.</p><p>Foo concludes that while SMEs may be wary about approaching financial institutions to fund their ventures, they should look into financing options offered by development financial institutions.</p>\n",

      "<p><strong>SPECIAL REMARKS BY</strong></p> <p><strong>YAB DATO’ SRI MOHD. NAJIB BIN TUN HAJI ABDUL RAZAK</strong></p> <p><strong>PRIME MINISTER OF MALAYSIA</strong></p> <p><strong>SPECIAL ADDRESS ON CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS AND GOVERNMENT’S FINANCIAL POSITION</strong></p> <p><br/> </p> <p>Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim </p> <p>Assalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh dan Salam 1 Malaysia</p> <p>YAB Tan Sri Muhyidin Yassin</p> <p>Timbalan Perdana Menteri</p> <p>YB Dato’ Seri Ahmad Husni Hanadzlah</p> <p>Menteri Kewangan Kedua</p> <p>YBhg. Tan Sri Dr. Ali Hamsa</p> <p>Ketua Setiausaha Negara 4</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>1. First and foremost, let us express our infinite gratitude towards Allah SWT for with His blessings, we are able to gather this morning. We also pray for the great prophet Muhammad SAW.</p> <p>2. We are here this morning with leaders and administrators, civil servants, industry players and corporate members, representatives of embassies, NGOs and volunteer groups, as well as the rakyat in this hall, and those watching TV or listening to the speech.</p> <p>3. I would like to address some concerns on the current economic developments and the Government’s financial position. Lately, there have been reports, concerns and queries on issues, such as crude oil prices and performance of the ringgit.</p> <p>4. The Government has been vigilantly monitoring the situation. In this regard, I will announce several proactive measures to realign our policies in line with the changing global economic scenario, which is beyond our control. We are undertaking this to ensure that we continue to achieve creditable growth.</p> <p>5. In other words, I am here today to announce specific and proactive measures to align ourselves with the recent global economic developments.</p> <p>6. We are not in crisis. Indeed, we are taking preemptive measures following the changes in the external global economic landscape which is beyond our control.</p> <p>7. This is to ensure that our economy continues to attain a respectable and reasonable growth. And at the same time, we want to ensure development for the nation and rakyat continues.</p> <p>8. Indeed, 2014 was a year of trials and tribulations for us due to several tragedies.</p> <p>9. At the end of last year, Malaysia was hit by unprecedented floods, affecting several states including Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, Kedah and Perak.</p> <p>10. Although the floods were not so severe in Johor, Sabah and Sarawak, local communities in some areas were affected.</p> <p>11. Thus, it is said that while man plans, Allah SWT plans too. And Allah SWT is the best of the planners.</p> <p>12. The Government has always done its best to plan, formulate and implement policies and measures for the betterment of the rakyat.</p> <p>13. It has been three months since the 2015 Budget was tabled. The Budget was formulated based on; First, price of Dated Brent was forecast at USD100 per barrel.</p> <p>14. Second, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth estimated between 5% and 6%. Third, a stable exchange rate of RM3.20 against the US dollar; and</p> <p>15. Fourth, 2015 world economic growth was projected at 3.4% and 3.9% by the World Bank and IMF respectively. Since then, the World Bank and the IMF have revised global growth to 3% and 3.8% respectively.</p> <p>16. It should be noted that Budget 2015 was formulated based on strong economic fundamentals in 2014. Therefore, the fiscal deficit was forecast from 3.5% in 2014 to 3% of GDP in 2015.</p> <p>17. However, the external situation has changed lately and we are impacted directly as Malaysia is among the largest trading nations in the world.</p> <p>18. Compared to the situation a few months ago, the global economic landscape has since changed significantly. This necessitates us to review and clarify some of our earlier macro and fiscal assumptions.</p> <p>19. Among the issues raised is the Government’s ability to achieve its fiscal targets for 2015. Given the current situation, the question is whether the economy and Government’s financial position will be affected.</p> <p>20. In this special address, I will explain to the rakyat and announce several measures to mitigate the current economic situation.</p> <p>21. As a responsible Government, we will continue to ensure economic development and safeguard the well-being of the rakyat.</p> <p><strong>Declining Crude Oil Prices</strong></p> <p>22. We are aware of the concerns among the rakyat, business community and analysts over the impact of the sharp fall in crude oil prices on the domestic economy.</p> <p>23. Over the last six months, global crude oil prices have plunged more than 50%, among others, due to oversupply amid weak demand.</p> <p>24. Leveraging advances in technology, shale oil and gas output has risen significantly in the US.</p> <p>25. The situation is exacerbated by higher output from non-OPEC (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries). OPEC is also not willing to undertake production cuts in order to maintain its market share.</p> <p>26. The Government has consistently reiterated that crude oil prices are beyond its control.</p> <p>27. The benchmark Dated Brent crude oil price has dropped to around USD48 per barrel on 19 January 2015. And analysts expect oil prices to take quite a while to stabilise.</p> <p><strong>Benefits of Declining Crude Oil Prices</strong></p> <p>28. Lower crude oil prices benefit net oil importing countries like Malaysia.</p> <p>29. For instance, the recent reduction in pump prices of petrol and diesel by 35 sen and 30 sen per litre, respectively will increase the overall disposable income of consumers by RM7.5 billion. Assuming that consumers spend 40% of this amount, it will boost private consumption by RM3 billion.</p> <p>30. The World Bank estimates that lower crude oil prices will have a positive impact on world GDP. In fact, a 30% decline in oil prices could boost global GDP of up to 0.5%.</p> <p>31. This bodes well for Malaysia’s manufactured products. Further, with the US economy strengthening, there will be sustained demand for our exports, in particular electrical and electronics (E&amp;E) products.</p> <p><strong>Falling Crude Oil Prices will Reduce Federal Government Revenue</strong></p> <p>32. In contrast, falling crude oil prices will reduce Government revenue. The revenue is used for development purposes such as building of schools, roads and houses of worship. It is also used for other expenditures such as salaries of civil servants, cost of medicine in Government hospitals, agriculture subsidies and expenditure for security including armed forces, police and RELA.</p> <p>33. In 2014, Dated Brent reached its highest level at USD115 per barrel on 19 June. Global crude oil prices have since plummeted by more than 50%.</p> <p>34. Consensus among economists is that the forecast price of USD100 per barrel used in the 2015 Budget is no longer realistic. They now estimate the average oil price in 2015 to range from USD40 to USD70 per barrel.</p> <p>35. The Government has therefore revised downwards its forecast for the average baseline oil price to USD55 per barrel for 2015.</p> <p>36. Based on the crude oil price of USD100 per barrel, coupled with savings following the implementation of the managed float pricing mechanism for retail fuel prices effective from December 2014, the Government is expected to get an additional operating surplus of RM3.7 billion.</p> <p>37. If crude oil price remains at USD100 per barrel, the Government will be able to accommodate all the measures announced in Budget 2015 with the fiscal deficit target not exceeding 3% of GDP.</p> <p>38. However, at the forecast price of USD55 per barrel, there will be a revenue shortfall of RM13.8 billion.</p> <p>39. If we compare the revised figures with Budget 2015 tabled in October last year, despite the savings of RM10.7 billion from the implementation of the managed float mechanism for retail fuel prices, the Government still faces a revenue shortfall of RM8.3 billion to accommodate the 2015 Budget measures.</p> <p>40. Without any fiscal measures, the deficit will increase to 3.9% of GDP against the target of 3% for 2015.</p> <p>41. This requires the Government to take measures to reduce the deficit, in line with the Government’s commitment towards fiscal consolidation.</p> <p>42. Therefore, taking into account the revised estimates, we are revising the fiscal deficit target to 3.2% of GDP in 2015.</p> <p>43. This is still lower than the fiscal deficit of 3.5% of GDP in 2014. In view of the external factors, we have to acknowledge that we may not be able to achieve the earlier fiscal target of 3% of GDP as announced. Of importance, is our commitment to continue reducing the fiscal deficit from 3.5% of GDP.</p> <p>44. More importantly, we will not compromise on national development planning as it will enhance productive capacity of the economy. We will not neglect the rakyat’s welfare, particularly the bottom 40% of households.</p> <p><strong>Volatile Capital Flows and Ringgit</strong></p> <p>45. The fluctuations in the ringgit are influenced by developments in the global economy. Hence, the ringgit is not the only currency to have weakened against the US dollar. In fact, almost all currencies in the region have softened against the US dollar since September 2014.</p> <p>46. The recent volatile capital flows and significant depreciation of the ringgit were also due to concerns over the impact of the sharp fall in oil prices on the Malaysian economy.</p> <p>47. In relation to this, we must closely monitor the following:</p> <p>First, the current account in the balance of payments must remain in surplus.</p> <p>Second, continue with fiscal reforms and consolidation and</p> <p>Third, economic activity must be further diversified to enable us to cope with falling crude oil and commodity prices.</p> <p>48. The Government is confident that the exchange rate will over time adjust to reflect the strong economic fundamentals. Of importance, our financial system continues to function in an orderly manner.</p> <p>49. Most importantly, there has been no disruption to financial intermediation, with lending activities continuing smoothly. Businesses continue to have access to financing from banking institutions and the capital market.</p> <p>50. In essence, greater policy flexibility, adequate international reserves, deeper and more diversified financial markets, sound banking system and strong domestic institutional investors such as the Employees Provident Fund will increase resilience to volatile capital flows.</p> <p><strong>Current Account Balance</strong></p> <p>51. The current account balance is directly related to the import and export of goods and services.</p> <p>52. We are a crude oil exporter. Thus, when oil prices plummeted recently, there was a perception that export receipts will also decline drastically and result in a current account deficit.</p> <p>53. Indeed, this perception is not correct. As a net crude oil exporter, we had a surplus of RM7.7bil from January to November 2014.</p> <p>54. However, we are an importer of petroleum products with a net import bill of RM8.9bil during the same period.</p> <p>55. If we include both crude oil and petroleum products, we are actually a net importer with a deficit of RM1.2bil.</p> <p>56. Therefore, the perception that Malaysia is a large oil producer is also not true.</p> <p>57. However, if we factor in exports and imports of crude oil, and nett out petroleum products, then Malaysia is a net importer of petroleum. This does not include LNG, for which Malaysia is a net exporter.</p> <p>58. Furthermore, we are still resilient as our diversified economy is able to weather the decline in oil prices.</p> <p>59. With a better outlook for the global economy in 2015, the shortfall in commodity receipts is expected to be cushioned by increased demand for manufactured goods, such as electrical and electronic products, wood-based products, textile products and others, which account for 76% of total exports. Meanwhile, crude oil exports account for only 4.5% of total exports.</p> <p>60. Therefore, the Government is confident that the current account will remain in surplus this year, although smaller in the range of 2% to 3% of Gross National Income or GNI. In 2014, the current account balance is estimated to record a surplus at 5.1% of GNI.</p> <p><strong>Strategies to Strengthen Economic Resilience</strong></p> <p>61. As I have explained earlier, there are several issues which will impact the domestic economy significantly. In the light of this, the Government will take measures to ensure economic growth remains on a strong trajectory. We are confident of achieving GDP growth in the range of 4.5% - 5.5% this year with the implementation of the following strategies:</p> <p>- First: Ensure balanced, inclusive and sustainable economic growth;</p> <p>- Second: Continue fiscal reforms and consolidation; and</p> <p>- Third: Provide assistance to the rakyat and business community to rebuild infrastructure damaged by floods.</p> <p>62. First Strategy: Ensuring Balanced, Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Growth To boost exports of goods and services, the following measures will be taken:</p> <p>First, actively promote import-substitution services such as shipping, port, education and professional services. This will reduce dependence on foreign sources for procurement of goods and services;</p> <p>Second, accelerate implementation of recommendations of National Export Council:</p> <p>- Enable exporters, especially SMEs, to be connected to new clients in new markets under an international linkage programme using market linkers and industry specialists;</p> <p>- Intensify export promotion programmes in 46 countries covering Asia, Europe, the Middle East and the US;</p> <p>- SME Bank will introduce SME-Go, an export programme for SMEs; and</p> <p>- Leverage the Services Export Fund (SEF) and promotional programmes for SMEs to enhance sustainability of projects abroad.</p> <p>Third, frontload implementation of Logistics &amp; Trade Facilitation:</p> <p>- Improve last-mile connectivity to Port Klang including access road, railway network and traffic management system;</p> <p>- Upgrade Padang Besar railway terminal;</p> <p>- Improve operational efficiency of import and export processes; and</p> <p>- Establish a hub and spoke system for air transport.</p> <p>Fourth, intensify tourism industry;</p> <p>Fifth, review levy on foreign workers; and</p> <p>Sixth, waiver of visa fee for tourists from, among others, China.</p> <p>To enhance private consumption, the Government will implement the following initiatives:</p> <p>First, give priority to local class G1 (class F), G2 (class E) and G3 (class D) contractors registered with CIDB to undertake reconstruction works in their respective flood affected areas;</p> <p>Second, intensify promotion of “Buy Malaysia” products;</p> <p>Third, increase frequency and extend shopping hours of nationwide mega sales;</p> <p>Fourth, accelerate promotion of domestic tourism through competitive domestic air fares; and</p> <p>Fifth, encourage the private sector to leverage benefits from the establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community.</p> <p>In efforts to accelerate private investment, the Government will:</p> <p>First, set up a Services Sector Guarantee Scheme amounting to RM5 billion for SMEs in the services sector, with maximum financing of RM5 million and 70% Government guarantee;</p> <p>Second, encourage GLCs and GLICs to invest domestically;</p> <p>Third, reduce cost of doing business:</p> <p>- Postpone the scheduled electricity tariff hike in 2015; and</p> <p>- Postpone the scheduled gas price hike for the industrial sector in 2015.</p> <p>Fourth, allocate 30% of the annual procurement budget of Government agencies and GLCs for goods and services to local SME producers; and</p> <p>Fifth, increase local goods and services in Government procurement.</p> <p>63. Second Strategy: Continuing Fiscal Reforms and Consolidation Among the revenue enhancement measures include:</p> <p>First, broaden the tax base by encouraging companies to register with the Royal Malaysian Customs to enable them to charge and collect GST. This is expected to contribute an additional RM1 billion in GST collection. As at mid-January 2015, more than 304,000 companies have registered; and</p> <p>Second, realise additional dividends from GLCs and GLICs as well as other Government entities amounting to RM400mil.</p> <p>The Government will undertake the following expenditure rationalisation measures:</p> <p>First, optimise outlays on supplies and services, especially overseas travel, events and functions and use of professional services. This will result in savings of RM1.6bil;</p> <p>Second, defer the 2015 Program Latihan Khidmat Negara to enable the programme to be reviewed and enhanced, with savings expected at RM400 million;</p> <p>Third, review transfers and grants to statutory bodies, GLCs and Government Trust Funds, particularly those with a steady revenue stream and high reserves. This measure will result in savings of RM3.2 billion; and</p> <p>Fourth, reschedule the purchase of non-critical assets, especially office equipment, software and vehicles, with an expected savings of RM300 million.</p> <p>64. Third Strategy: Assisting the Rakyat and Business Community as well as Rebuilding Infrastructure Damaged by the Floods</p> <p>The recent floods affected around 400,000 people nationwide. The latest estimate of damage to infrastructure is about RM2.9bil.</p> <p>Among the measures that have been taken and will be implemented to assist flood victims include:</p> <p>The Government has provided an initial allocation of RM500 million for rehabilitation works and welfare programmes for flood victims.</p> <p>This is in addition to the existing allocation to the National Security Council, bringing the total to RM787mil.</p> <p>Provide an initial allocation of RM800mil for repair and reconstruction of basic infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, roads and bridges;</p> <p>Provide RM893 million under the 2015 Budget for flood mitigation projects;</p> <p>Build 8-ft stilt houses for those who have land and whose homes were damaged by the floods; Hand over 1,000 units of completed low-cost houses in Gua Musang; Provide RM500 per flood affected household; and Provide RM5,000 for the next-of-kin who have lost family members.</p> <p>65. For businesses affected by floods:</p> <p>- Provide an additional RM100 million to TEKUN and RM100 million to AIM to provide soft loans to support SMEs and microenterprises.</p> <p>66. BSN, Agrobank, SME Bank, TEKUN and AIM to defer existing loan repayments of up to six months.</p> <p>67. Bank Negara Malaysia will establish a RM500 million Special Relief Facility for SME loan financing at a concessionary rate of 2.25% with a grace period of up to six months through banking and development financial institutions;</p> <p>68. Bank Rakyat will offer a personal loan scheme of up to RM50,000 at a financing rate as low as 3.9%, while loan repayments will start after six months from loan disbursement;</p> <p>69. A sum of RM500 million will be provided by financial institutions with a 70% guarantee under a Flood Relief Loan Guarantee Scheme (Skim Jaminan Pinjaman Bantuan Banjir) (SJPBB). The Scheme will be administered by Prokhas; and</p> <p>70. Exempt levy payment to the Human Resources Development Fund (HRDF) for a period of six months for SMEs in the flood affected areas with effect from 1 February 2015.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p><strong>To sum up, I would like to highlight 6 key take-aways:</strong></p> <p>First, we are neither in a recession nor a crisis as experienced in 1997/1998, and 2009 which warranted stimulus packages;</p> <p>Second, the strategies announced by the Government are proactive initiatives to make the necessary adjustments following the challenging external developments which are beyond our control. This is a reality check following, among others, declining global crude oil prices;</p> <p>Third, the current account balance is expected to remain in surplus;</p> <p>Fourth, the financial markets remain orderly and resilient. Although the ringgit has depreciated, it is expected to stabilise over time to reflect the strong economic fundamentals;</p> <p>Fifth, Development Expenditure of RM48.5 billion for 2015 will be maintained and spent.</p> <p>This includes projects for the people economy such as public housing, flood mitigation, water supply, electricity and public transport infrastructure such as Pan-Borneo Highway.</p> <p>In addition, projects such as the MRT Line 2, LRT 3, High-Speed Rail Kuala Lumpur-Singapore will be continued.</p> <p>In May, I will table the Eleventh Malaysia Plan (11MP) to outline the development expenditure until 2020.</p> <p>Sixth, Operating Expenditure is expected to be reduced by RM5.5 billion through reprioritising expenditure.</p> <p>71.

The board will also play a greater oversight role in providing strategic direction to the DFIs,” it added.</p><p> Bank Negara said the amendments would also further elevate the level of consumer protection and transparency. </p><p> “Customers of the DFIs are accorded the required protection and the level of transparency for financial products and services as those of the banking institutions. The amendments would also ensure that DFI’s business conduct when dealing with its customers is fair, responsible and professional,” it added.</p><p> The amendment also proposes for the inclusion of syariah requirements to guide DFIs that conduct Islamic business activities.</p><p> A comprehensive penalty framework would also be incorporated to allow for efficient enforcement tools in addressing non-compliance effectively, the central bank said. </p><p> The DFIA is a regulatory framework which aims to promote safe and sound management of DFIs.

These include launching a crowd-funding platform and developing operating rules for a National Bill Payment Scheme, according to the newly-released Economic Transformation Programme annual report for 2013. </p><p> The launch of a crowd-funding platform by the Securities Commission follows the introduction of a conceptual framework for Malaysia’s first online platform for unlisted securities and alternative investment products, or MyULM, last year.  </p><p> This is to provide a platform to match investors with small and medium enterprises seeking financing to expand their business.</p><p> The report said NKEA also aimed to establish a framework for the provision of basic life insurance and family takaful products through direct channels this year; and organise investor education and awareness programmes to promote the Private Retirement Scheme. </p><p> The NKEA also expects to finalise the Asean Banking Integration Framework for endorsement at the Asean finance ministers’ meeting this year.</p><p> As Bursa Malaysia looks to grow retail participation and build a trading and investing mindset amongst Malaysians, especially the younger generation, the exchange is focusing on technology and innovative channels such as the digital platform to expand its reach. Bursa Malaysia is hopeful that the launch of the new eCommunity platform in the first half of 2014 will enable the exchange to reach a wider span of retail investors, in a quicker and more efficient manner. </p><p> The report said the exchange would continue to leverage on Asean growth to attract more investors to the Malaysian market, as part of its efforts to become Asean’s leading marketplace. </p><p> Second Finance Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Husni Hanadzlah said it was essential for Malaysia to develop its financial sector carefully and assiduously, as the industry played a significant role in ensuring stability and facilitating the development of the country’s economy.</p><p> In the face of potential sources of systemic risk, Ahmad Husni said it was imperative that efforts were put in place to ensure the resilience of the country’s financial system.</p><p> The financial services NKEA successfully met almost all of its key performance indicators last year. These included the issuance of a sustainable social lending framework for development financial institutions, devising the framework on a trading venue for unlisted firms, and surpassing the target value of new listings (including GLC listings).</p><p> The report said NKEA was focused on developing Malaysia’s financial industry in tandem with the needs of a high-income nation. The 10 entry point projects have been put in place to strengthen the industry’s core; serve the needs of a high-income population; develop new growth sectors; and aggressively target new markets and enhance the industry’s niche in Islamic finance. </p><p> The initiatives target to grow the industry’s gross national income contribution to RM180.2bil and create 275,400 new jobs by 2020.</p>\n",

      "<div><br/> </div> <p>PETALING JAYA: A move to restructure the Government’s housing loan division will shave the fiscal debt and possibly raise housing loan growth by commercial banks.</p> <p>Analysts are expecting the Government to transfer RM42bil's worth of civil servant housing loans into the banking system, whereby staff will pay the normal 4% per annum and the Government will subsidise any interest above that threshold.</p> <p>All commercial banks are also expected to be eligible to participate in providing housing loans for government servants, and analysts expect the transfer of loans to commercial banks and development financial institutions will lower total federal government debt by around 4% to 4.5% from 51.8% of GDP as of June 30, 2013. </p> <p>The idea to restructure the Government’s housing loan division was first mentioned in last year’s Budget as part of efforts to consolidate the fiscal deficit and to ease the Government’s financial burden. During the budget speech it was mentioned that the Government would appoint panels from commercial banks to manage new housing loans effective January 2013. </p> <p>But this had yet to implemented, said a local research house. </p> <p>The research house reckoned the staff housing loans would be transferred to government-owned development financial institutions such as Bank Rakyat, Bank Simpanan Nasional, Agro Bank and Bank Pembangunan, which will manage and administer the existing stock and future stream of civil service home loans. </p> <p>Another a local bank-backed brokerage analyst said whether it made sense or not for banks to be allowed to handle government staff housing loans would much depend on the profitability of such loans.</p> <p>“Banks should take into account whether in the long term it is profitable to do so after weighing in various factors such as its capital consideration and interest rate environment, among others,’’ he told StarBiz.</p> <p>He said the treasury housing loans charged a flat rate of 4% (compared with between 4.2% and 4.3% for new home loans by commercial banks), and it would all depend on whether banks make a profit after taking into consideration the above factors over the long term.</p> <p>An industry observer said the move could uplift loan growth in the banking system, coupled with other positive factors, if some of the RM42bil were to be transferred to commercial banks. </p> <p>Another bank-backed analyst said the transfer could be positive for the banking system as the recent measures to shorten the tenure for mortgage and personal loans, as well as the potential fiscal tightening by the Federal Government via subsidy rationalisation programme in the later part of the year, could dampen loan growth momentum in the retail segments.</p> <p>This move to transfer could to an extent boost loan growth in the banking system moving forward. Total banking system loan growth to date stands at RM1.17tril. Some analysts are, however, maintaining their loan growth projections this year. </p> <p>On a year-to-date annualised basis, the banking system’s outstanding loans growth was relatively flattish at 9.8% in August. Property loans remained the key driver, where loans for the purchase of residential and non-residential properties accounted for 56% of credit growth. </p> <p>This is followed by working capital and hire purchase loans, contributing 15.2% and 11% of credit growth, respectively.</p> <p>Lending indicators for August gained momentum year-on-year, but fell on a month-on-month basis. </p> <p> Loan applications, approvals and disbursements dropped by 9.9%, 8.1% and 2.4% month-on-month to RM67.5bil (July 2013: RM75bil), RM33.5bil (July 2013: RM36.5bil) and RM80.1bil (July 2013: RM82.1bil), respectively.</p>\n",

      "<p>PETALING JAYA: Although the latest measures introduced by Bank Negara to rein in household debt would ensure a sound and sustainable household sector, more is needed to prevent debt from reaching alarming levels, said economists.</p><p> The household debt in Malaysia, which stands at about 83% of gross domestic product (GDP), is higher than many other countries in the region like the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan. If not prevented, it could put a damper on the country’s 5%-6% projected GDP growth this year.</p><p> RAM Holdings Bhd group chief economist Dr Yeah Kim Leng said he believes the latest measures, in combination with the earlier ones, would have the cumulative, albeit modest and gradual, effect of crimping household debt. </p><p> The latest measures would help to moderate the increase in total household debt, as the earlier responsible lending guidelines introduced last year have only had a marginal impact on slowing down the rise in total household debt to 13.0% in 2012 from 13.4% in 2011. </p><p> Certain measures, therefore, have to be in place in combination with the existing ones to ensure the soundness and sustainability of the household sector. “The loan-to-value (LTV), currently at 70% for the third housing loan, and debt-to-income net of all other borrowing measures, could be further tightened. For instance, the 70% LTV could be lowered or applied to the second or first loan, while the debt-to-income could be lowered to 30% instead of 50% of monthly net income,’’ he told <i>StarBiz</i>. </p><p> In addition, he said the net income could be defined more stringently to include other obligations of the borrower. To rein in excessive property price increases that have contributed to rising property loan demand, the real property gains tax (RPGT) could be further raised to curb speculative activities, he added. </p><p> Other complementary measures needed include efforts to boost housing supply and containing construction cost increases, he said, adding that more blunt monetary measures such as raising the overnight policy rate or banks’ reserve requirements could be applied if the macro-prudential measures applied thus far prove inadequate to contain household debt build-up.</p><p> The latest measures by the central bank to curb household debt include imposing a maximum tenure of 10 years for the repayment of personal loans and a maximum of 35 years for property loans, and prohibiting the offering of pre-approved personal financing products.</p><p> Apart from this, key credit providers are required to observe prudent debt service ratios in their credit assessment to ensure households have sufficient buffers to protect them against rising costs and unexpected adverse events. The bank’s new measures also bring some of the lending practices at development financial institutions and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) in line with those of conventional banks.</p><p> Malaysian Rating Corporation Bhd chief economist Nor Zahidi Alias said more measures were needed to curb speculative activities. “Implementing more measures to curb speculative activities in the property market can be positive. This may include a lower LTV ratio for third property purchases, higher stamp duty for property transactions and higher RPGT. All these would help curb speculative activities,’’ he noted.</p><p> He said the latest measures by the central bank were positive in view of the serious level of household debt in the country. The growth in personal financing has been robust in the past several years, especially among NBFIs, he said, adding that NBFIs had collectively extended 57% of personal financing credit to households in 2012. </p><p> Zahidi said no doubt they are secured by automatic salary deductions (for civil servants), but the rapid surge in the amount of personal financing extended to households would pose some sort of risk to the economy through a possible decline in private consumption in the event of a serious downturn.</p><p> He foresees the household debt level beginning to stabilise next year should the new measures begin to take effect in controlling the growth in personal financing. He said no doubt there was still a sizeable amount of loans related to mortgages, but at least, they were backed by underlying assets.</p><p> In a recent report, Bank Negara governor Tan Sri Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz noted that housing loans formed the bulk of Malaysia’s household debt at 44.5%, while 16.8% were personal loans.</p>\n",

      "<p>THIS is turning out to be generally an interesting time for <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=MBSB\" target=\"_blank\">MALAYSIA BUILDING SOCIETY BHD</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=MBSB\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a> (MBSB) following the enforcement of Financial Services Act 2013 (FSA). The non-bank financial provider next course of action will be closely-watched by investors and the industry. </p> <p> Under the previous Banking and Financial Institution Act 1989 (Bafia), MBSB is defined as a scheduled institution. The status of an exempt finance company was granted to MBSB on March 1, 1972 by the Finance Ministry and the status has remained since and is thus not bounded by any financial regulators in Malaysia. The status allows MBSB to undertake a financing business in the absence of a banking license. </p> <p> Analysts say under the new legislation, the Finance Ministry could designate financial intermediaries not under the supervision of central bank as a prescribed financial institution, if such intermediaries are deemed to pose a risk to financial stability, thus it will be interesting to see what will this mean for MBSB. </p> <p> Alliance Research analyst Cheah King Yoong says under Section 212 of the FSA, Bank Negara is authorised to supervise entities previously not under its charge. </p> <p> “Bank Negara is authorised to supervise financial entities previously not under the supervision of the central bank but are now deemed to pose a systemic risk to the overall financial stability by the Finance Ministry. This could impact the relatively large non-banking entities currently not under supervision of Bank Negara such as MBSB,” he says. </p> <p> In addition, Maybank Investment Bank Research analyst Desmond Ch’ng says technically, this could bring MBSB and the development financial institutions (DFIs) under BNM’s purview, but only if they pose a risk to financial stability.</p> <p> “Assuming MBSB is designated as a prescribed financial institution, the near-term impact could be negative from a reclassification of its non-performing loan (NPL) on a 3-month rather than 6-month basis which could raise NPL levels and the need to shore up capital,</p> <p> “Secondly, MBSB would likely have to raise equity capital much sooner than expected to bolster its capital base (its Tier 1 capital ratio was 6.6% end-Sep 2012),” Ch’ng says. </p> <p> </p> <div class=\"embeded-image inline-image-left\"> <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com.my/~/media/BAA1B00509E846638371D123BB7A8CC9.ashx\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"128\" src=\"https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/8A398CE8-EF3C-4BBF-BD04-BD5E42F0DDBA\" width=\"200\"/></a> <div class=\"inline-caption\">Click on image for larger view</div> </div> <p> Reclassifying MBSB’s NPLs from six months to a three-month basis is necessary to enable MBSB to evaluate the progress of its transformation vis-à-vis the commercial banks under Bank Negara’s purview.</p> <p> A local bank-backed analyst says that presently, it remains “status quo” for MBSB unless it is deemed as posing a systemic risk to the financial stability. “MBSB is not governed under the now repealed BAFIA and its books are not audited. The caveat for MBSB to come under the central bank’s charge is if it is deemed risky.”</p> <p> He adds that the FSA opens up an opportunity for Bank Negara to look at its books as they don’t have any restriction from doing that for now. </p> <p> Analysts say the concern on MBSB is its burgeoning portfolio of personal loans to civil servants. </p> <p> Started in 1950 as the Federal and Colonial Building Society Ltd, the loan portfolio for MBSB has grown significantly from just providing mortgages. Its biggest earnings contributor now is made up of personal loans to civil servants and it has since expanded into financing retail businesses, corporate outfits, wholesale banking and treasury products.</p> <p> As at Dec 31, 2012 (FY12), MBSB’s total loans rose to RM24.3bil with the bulk of it coming from personal loans. </p> <p> MBSB’s Personal Financing-i (PF-i) has grown tremendously in the past five years. In 2009, its PF-i accounted for just about 11.6% of its gross loans and this has swelled to 66.3% in 2012. Concurrently, its mortgage which formed the bulk of its gross loans in 2009 accounting for 47.9% has reduced to 18.5% in the first quarter. Its auto loans are gaining traction, especially since the company tied up with the Naza Group.</p> <p> In addition, MBSB has also been reducing its total net NPL ratios over the years to 4.5% in FY12 from a high of 19.54% in 2009. MBSB’s deposit growth has also registered a significant growth in FY12. Its deposit rose to RM21.5bil in FY12 from RM7.6bil in FY09. </p> <p> In the first quarter ended March 31, 2013, MBSB saw its net loans and financing grew more than 50% to RM26.6bil from RM17.6bil in the first quarter in 2012. It reported a net profit of RM166.14mil or 13.08 sen per share in the first quarter ended March 31 compared with RM79.41mil or 6.53 sen per share a year ago, underpinned by its Islamic banking operations and lower impairment losses.</p> <p> MBSB’s pre-tax profit surged 114.6% to RM237.11mil from RM110.47mil while revenue rose 48.4% to RM562.47mil from RM378.88mil.</p> <p> For 2013, MBSB aims to bring its loan-to-deposit ratio down to 95%, while a 20% target has been set for loan and deposit growth.</p> <p> Nevertheless, MBSB is already working towards complying with Bank Negara guidelines but is not in a hurry to get a banking licence from Bank Negara. In March, MBSB chief operating officer Clifford Anthony Clement reportedly said MBSB is already revamping its internal structure to prepare to comply with the FSA. </p> <p> President and chief executive officer Datuk Ahmad Zaini Othman says MBSB must first practise and perform like a bank before its application can be approved by the central bank. “Licence is something that can come later but we must get ready to operate and move into the banking environment first to train ourselves to be ready.”</p> <p><br/> </p> <strong>Related stories:</strong> <br/> <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=F5EF6A99E30D426AA11855851EA1BFF9&amp;_z=z\">Shadow banking crisis</a> <br/> <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=2E7DA1F01D7C44E394F93026AE02D7A0&amp;_z=z\">Angkasa in the news for overlending</a> <br/> <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=62C881DB1CAC4A9296DF0E95BAEC26BC&amp;_z=z\">Bank Rakyat aims for more balanced portfolio</a> <p><br/> </p> <p><br/> </p>\n",

At the moment, we have no plans to apply for it,” chief operating officer Clifford Anthony Clement said.</p><p>Asked if MBSB had set any official timeframe to apply for the DFI, Clifford answered “No”.</p><p>There has been industry talk that MBSB would soon come under the fold of the DFI under the purview of Bank Negara and governed in accordance with the Development Financial Institutions Act 2002.</p><p>Meanwhile, the non-bank lender also said it was preparing itself for the upcoming Financial Services Act (FSA) that is expected to come into force in the middle of this year.</p><p>“Internally, we are preparing ourselves for it. From what we understand, we assume that the FSA would better the financial landscape for all players,” Clifford said.</p><p>He said among the elements that MBSB was looking at internally was its processes, board structure, improving its processes, shareholding, compliance and portfolio guidelines.</p><p>“We are doing it now, and even from last year (management) had asked us to look at where we could improve our processes.

Personal financing today has evolved somewhat. It is no longer an unnecessary product to encourage indebtedness,” noted Clifford.</p><p>He said personal financing is presently also utilised to reduce credit card differential repayments that could be leveraged upon with the former's lower rates.</p><p>He said the facility was also used by many of its customers to pay for their children's education, or parents' hospitalisation fees.</p><p>MBSB said its outlook this year was “going strong”, leveraging on the strength of the overall consumer market.</p><p>“You can see a lot of housing projects being launched.

These include 3,853 oil palm planters (of which 4% are smallholders), 584 palm oil wholesalers and 382 palm oil manufacturers.</p> <p> </p> <p>Small and medium enterprises are the backbone of Malaysia's economy as they make up 97.3% of the total business establishments here, says SME Corp Economics and Policy Planning Division senior <a href=\"http://archives.thestar.com.my/search/?q=K.%20Karunajothi\" rel=\"foaf:homepage\" target=\"_blank\">director K.

      "<p>FINALLY, the Audit Oversight Board (AOB) has imposed its first sanction. On July 12, more than two years after it had been set up, the board reprimanded Alvin Tee Guan Pian, the senior partner of accounting firm UHY Malaysia.</p><p>The AOB only provided a brief description of the breach: “Failure to comply with the relevant requirements of the recognised auditing standards in Malaysia i.e. the International Standards on Auditing.”</p><p>Tee was penalised because he was the engagement partner in the audit of a public interest entity (PIE) for the financial year ended July 31, 2010. It appears that the breach had to do with the way the audit was conducted.</p><p>Apart from listed companies, PIEs include banking and financial institutions (including Islamic banks and development financial institutions), insurance companies and takaful operators, and holders of Capital Market Services Licences (such as securities and futures trading firms, and fund management companies).</p><p>The AOB's refusal to reveal more about why Tee deserved a reprimand invites us to play the guessing game. Which of the many International Standards on Auditing applies in this case? And in what way exactly did Tee fail to comply with the auditing standard or standards? Why did this merit a sanction?</p><p>It was UHY that threw some light on this matter through a press release it issued on July 16 in response to a StarBiz report on the reprimand.</p><p>The firm's explanation is that there is a clash of opinions on whether it was right to believe that the PIE was a going concern back when its 2010 accounts were audited.</p><p>Said the press release: “UHY elaborated that the particular PIE was merely undergoing a recapitalisation exercise, where the focus on UHY's decision to concur with its client's going concern assumption' has been an area that the AOB differs in terms of its technical view of the matter. UHY believes it has strong grounds to appeal the AOB decision as the differing views are judgemental in nature.”</p><p>A fundamental principle in the preparation of financial statements, the going concern assumption simply means that the management of an organisation has no reason to believe that the organisation's operations will come to a halt in the foreseeable future.</p><p>When doing an audit, the auditor has to decide whether the use of the going concern assumption is appropriate.</p><p>The AOB has not responded to the UHY statement, although when speaking to StarBiz earlier, AOB executive chairman Nik Mohamed Hasyudeen Yusoff took pains to point out that the reprimand didn't mean that the PIE's 2010 accounts didn't give a true and fair view of the PIE's financial position and performance.</p><p>Instead, he added, the reprimand was because the auditor failed to do what was necessary in performing the audit.</p><p>But what was it that wasn't done? We won't know until the AOB and UHY decide to say more.</p><p>Meanwhile, it's useful to look at the AOB's annual reports for 2010 and 2011, which talk about issues concerning the going concern assumption that were uncovered when the board reviewed the audit work of some firms.</p><p>In 2010, the AOB highlighted several weaknesses in this area, such as auditors not doing enough to assess the appropriateness of the going concern assumption although there were signs of going concern issues; lack of evidence that the auditors had challenged key assumptions used by management to support the basis for going concern; and a majority of auditors failing to perform an independent stress test or sensitivity analysis.</p><p>The board then became specific: “In three instances, there were disclosures in the financial statements or management's representation letter which point to significant doubt or dependence of a future event to support their ability to continue operating as going concern entities. However, the audit opinion did not reflect the substance of such disclosures.</p><p>“In another instance, while an Emphasis of Matter' opinion relating to going concern was issued, the description of the facts supporting the opinion gave a different connotation as though there was no default in debt obligations.</p><p>Some of these issues observed in the 2010 inspections persisted the following year, judging from the comments in the AOB's annual report 2011.</p><p>“The AOB reiterates the need for assessing the fundamental assumptions of going concern made by management in the preparation of financial statements. Audit firms need to improve in this area as our inspection revealed that the performance of audit procedures is generally lacking,” said the board in the latest annual report.</p><p>“It is important to acknowledge that going concern considerations involve risks of key judgment area especially when the management's assessment may not be realistic.”</p><p>Clearly, this is an area that calls for professional scepticism, something that auditors are expected to exercise in spades in the course of their work.</p><p>There is no easy way to determine how sceptical an auditor should be in assessing the appropriateness of the use of the going concern assumption, but the AOB reprimand last week suggests that an intimate knowledge of the International Standards on Auditing is always desirable.</p><p>&gt; Executive editor Errol Oh was told that professional scepticism is in short supply, but he doesn't believe it.  </p>\n",

The reprimand is because the auditor failed to do what was necessary in performing the audit,” he explained.</p><p>This is why the AOB has not named the PIE whose 2010 audit was at the heart of this case.</p><p>Following amendments to the SC Act 1993, the AOB began operations in April 2010 to oversee the auditors of PIEs and to promote confidence in the quality and reliability of the PIEs' audited financial statements.</p><p>PIEs include listed companies, banking and financial institutions (including Islamic banks and development financial institutions), insurance companies and takaful operators, and holders of Capital Market Services Licences (such as securities and futures trading firms, and fund management companies).</p><p>A major part of the board's work is the annual registration of audit firms and individual auditors, who are the firms' partners or sole properietors.</p><p>Including Tee, UHY has three individual auditors on the AOB's register, and the firm is the external auditor of almost 20 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia.</p><p>Previously, the AOB has relied on other enforcement measures in response to lapses by firms and auditors.</p><p>For example, when five firms accepted appointments in 2010 as auditors of PIEs without first registering with the board, they were given show-cause letters followed by warning letters.</p><p>Last year, when the AOB found shortcomings while reviewing some audit jobs, it shortened the tenure of registration for the three engagement partners from the usual one year to six months.</p><p>The SC Act provides for a range of “administrative-type” sanctions by the AOB such as the imposition of certain conditions, suspension, fines, reprimands, compulsory professional education, prohibition from accepting PIE clients or auditing PIEs' accounts, and deregistration.</p><p>While some may deem a reprimand a soft option among the sanctions, Nik Hasyudeen said: “We don't necessarily consider a reprimand a light form of enforcement action.</p><p>“Any action from our side is a serious thing.”</p><p>An AOB sanction is subject to an appeal to the SC within 30 days from the date of notification of the decision.</p><p>Tee has not responded to an e-mail from StarBiz asking for his comment on the reprimand.</p><p>According to a March 2012 press release, UHY in Malaysia is a partnership with four offices and more than 100 professionals.</p><p>It is part of the UHY international network of independent accounting and consulting firms.</p>\n",

      "<p>PETALING JAYA: Bank Negara is closely monitoring the activities of non-bank institutions or shadow banks that are not regulated under the mainstream banking system, sources told StarBiz.</p><p>“The situation is not yet a cause for alarm but the authorities want to make sure that they do not pose a risk to the banking system and that their unregulated lending does not create a bubble like what happened in the US prior to the global financial crisis,'' a source said.</p><p>Concerns over non-bank lending have surfaced in the wake of the implementation of responsible lending guidelines in the regular banking system.</p><p>Bank Negara's financial stability report 2011 quotes a Federal Reserve Bank of New York staff report that the volume of credit intermediated by the shadow banking system in the United States was nearly twice (about 1.8 times) as large as the volume of credit intermediated by the traditional banking system prior to the global financial crisis.</p><p>In Malaysia, the nature and scale of the activities of these non-bank intermediaries are much less complex and account for a much smaller share of total credit intermediated by the banking system.</p><p>Moreover, the bulk of the activities and the non-bank entities themselves are subject to oversight of Bank Negara and the Securities Commission.</p><p>“The control over the mainstream banks will be less effective if the activity flows at the non-bank institutions are not under some form of control,'' said Pong Teng Siew, head of research at Interpac Securities. “In the process, banks may be asked to rein in their lending to these non-bank institutions.''</p><p>There are instances when banks, wanting to achieve a certain continuous pace of growth, will set up non-bank conduits and channel the lending to them.</p><p>“That is what happened in the United States but in Malaysia, the central bank is powerful. It will find out what they are doing,'' said Pong. “They ought to be monitored closely, especially if the holding company is also to get a piece of action.''</p><p>In monitoring these non-bank institutions, certain areas such as lending to civil servants, may be the focus. “Excessive lending may, at some point, lead to a credit trap where these civil servants use up all their money to service their loans via salary deductions.'' said Pong. “They may then turn to other sources of borrowing.''</p><p>In many instances, loose credit standards and lack of credit analysis can also lead to other problems.</p><p>Recently, the activities and size of assets of these non-bank lenders have expanded. “The growth in financing extended has been mainly focused on the household sector but continues to represent a small share (5.9%) of total financing to households,'' said Bank Negara in its financial stability report.</p><p>“To ensure that these developments do not, over time, contribute towards the imprudent build-up of leverage in the household sector, the central bank's surveillance of developments in the lending activities by non-bank lenders has been strengthened in close cooperation with the relevant supervisory authorities.</p><p>“Specific measures have also been implemented to ensure that credit co-operative societies and large building societies observe responsible financing practices that are consistent with regulations applied to the financial institutions under the bank's purview,'' said Bank Negara.</p><p>In March, Malaysian Rating Corp (MARC) expressed concern that the pace of lending by non-bank institutions, for example, development financial institutions such as Bank Pembangunan, Bank Kerjasama Rakyat and Bank Simpanan Nasional, had been relatively high in the past few years.</p><p>It has averaged 14.5% a year since 2005 and moderated to 7.2% in 2011.</p><p>In voicing its concerns over the quantity and quality of loans given out, MARC had pointed out that lending for “consumption credit” had grown at a compounded average growth rate (CAGR) of 20.3% a year in the past seven years with the pace of growth in the lending for the credit cards segment, which has seen a CAGR of 50.4% a year since 2005.</p><p>In its financial sector blueprint, Bank Negara spoke of the development of a framework for monitoring and managing risks arising from entities and activities taking place outside the directly supervised financial system.</p><p>The steps involve enhancing data collection and surveillance of such entities and activities particularly those of systemic importance and implementing appropriate regulatory responses to preemptively manage emerging risks.</p>\n",

      "<p>NON-BANK lenders appear to be unperturbed by the introduction of stringent lending guidelines as their client base is different and they have internal targets to meet.</p><p>According to an industry observer, non-bank lenders like cooperatives, certain development financial institutions (DFIs) and Malaysian Building Society Bhd (MBSB) have a huge client base comprising mainly civil servants, and their targets are not solely determined by market forces.</p><p>The Responsible Financing Guidelines which took effect from Jan 1 are to control household debt, and banks have to approve loans based on the borrower's net income rather than gross income. This has resulted in some analysts lowering the loan growth and earning projections for banks.</p><p>Malaysian Rating Corp Bhd chief economist Nor Zahidi Alias hopes that cooperatives and DFIs would operate in line with the lending guidelines as well to ensure that there is no over-lending by these non-bank institutions.</p><p>Statistics reveal that the rate of lending from DFIs to certain segments like consumption credit has been very rapid since 2005, averaging 24.4% per annum. More astounding was the lending for credit cards which rose at a robust pace of 50.4% on a compound annual growth rate basis, rising from barely RM33mil to RM566mil  in six years.</p><p>This year, MBSB is looking at a loan growth of over 20%, driven by its personal financing and corporate loan portfolios. Chief executive Datuk Ahmad Zaini Othman recently said it was targeting between RM8bil and RM9bil of new personal financing this year compared with RM7bil last year.</p><p>The new financing guidelines, he said, would have little impact on MBSB, adding that it had observed a lot of the guidelines. He was quoted as saying that “although we are not compelled to follow the guidelines, at the working level, we follow the spirit of the guidelines.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Phillip Capital Management Sdn Bhd in its recent note after attending MBSB's fourth quarter results for 2011, said the management of  MBSB  had said it had no plans to slow down disbursements this year even if targets were met earlier, unlike last year where disbursements were consciously slowed down in the fourth quarter of last year once the target was met, and in anticipation of new products to be introduced this year.</p><p>To recap, MBSB's net profit for the financial year ended Dec 31 (FY2011) surged 123% year-on-year to RM325mil, bulk of which was underpinned by higher income from its Islamic banking operation via the expansion of personal financing.</p><p>The research house has called for a buy for MBSB as it continued to deliver new record earnings and persistent solid loan growth. Despite its superior net interest margins (company's target of at least 4% in FY2012 compared with FY2011 of 4.66%) and loan growth above the banking industry average (where consensus expects loan growth to be 6%-11% in FY2012), it believed MBSB would surprise the market with its first quarter results in two months time.</p><p>Phillip Capital also noted that it was upbeat about MBSB as it had managed to secure approvals from the federal and various state accountant-generals (AGs) to use the AG's direct salary deduction code for personal loans taken by government staff.</p><p>The cost of running an AG code is cheaper with only RM1 per transaction compared with 1.5% commission for each deduction to be charged by Angkasa. Commercial banks are currently barred from using the AG code, it noted.</p><p>Angkasa is the apex cooperative for all cooperatives in Malaysia and has been authorised to deduct civil servants' salaries directly for loan repayment through its division Biro Perkhidmatan Angkasa (BPA). Borrowers' monthly salaries are deducted by the respective government departments and channelled to BPA, which then transfers the monthly instalments to the cooperatives.</p><p>Non-bank lenders including MBSB are also likely to benefit from the civil servants' salary increases of between 7% and 13% under an improved Malaysian Remuneration System, according to analysts.</p><p>Early this month, the Government said it was scrapping the New Remuneration Scheme for civil servants (SBPA) and the existing Malaysian Remuneration System would be reintroduced with some enhancements. The previous SBPA was met with criticism from government employees who claimed that the scheme awarded salary increases that benefited higher ranking civil servants.</p><p>Inter-Pacific Securities Sdn Bhd head of research Pong Teng Siew feels the lending guidelines will affect the profitability of DFIs and MBSB as they have been included when the central bank circulated the guidelines to financial institutions to prevent regulatory arbitrage.</p><p>Pong says Bank Negara governor Tan Sri Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz has given notice that she will look next at extending these guidelines to the shadow banking system  non-bank lenders/non-depository financial institutions like leasing companies, credit companies and retail credit organisations  although no time frame had been set.</p><p>In response to a query from  StarBizWeek on its loan growth in view of the lending guidelines, Bank Rakyat says it expects its financing growth to be around 9% mainly driven by consumer financing. Currently, its financing portfolio mix is about 90% consumer financing and the rest from the commercial financing.</p><p>In its 2011 financial results briefing, Bank Rakyat said it was targeting to grow its net profit to RM2.1bil amid the sluggish economic environment and tighter banking guidelines.</p>\n",

      "<p>PETALING JAYA: One of the more effective ways to contain Malaysia's rising household debt is by limiting the amount of lending by non-bank institutions in certain categories, particularly consumption credit, according to Malaysian Rating Corp Bhd (MARC).</p><p>Apart from the regulated banking sector, the rating agency said households also borrow from entities that were not regulated by the central bank such as cooperative societies and money lenders.</p><p>Based on Bank Negara statistics, the rating agency added it clearly indicated that the pace of lending by non-banking institutions (for example, development financial institutions (DFIs) such as Bank Pembangunan, Bank Kerjasama Rakyat and Bank Simpanan Nasional) had been relatively high in the past few years, averaging 14.5% per annum since 2005 despite moderating to 7.2% in 2011.</p><p>The growth peaked at 17.6% in 2007, MARC said, adding that a further breakdown revealed that lending for the segment categorised as consumption credit' had grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.3% per annum in the past seven years.</p><p>More staggering was the pace of growth in the lending for the credit cards segment which recorded a CAGR of 50.4% per annum since 2005, MARC said in its research note on the Bank Negara Annual Report 2011.</p><p>Overall, the level of household debt continued to edge higher to 76.6% of gross domestic product (GDP) (2010: 75.8% of GDP) in 2011, albeit at a slower pace than in the prior year (2011: 12.5%; 2010: +13.7%).</p><p>“We still hold on to our view that the continuous escalation in household sector debt cannot be arrested unless there are some fundamental changes in the business strategies of Malaysian banks and non-bank financial institutions.</p><p>“With the progressive increases in household income and increased acceptance of consumerism, the household sector has been perceived as a safe-bet for the banking sector.</p><p>“In addition, this strategy was adopted to avoid a substantial spike in corporate defaults that banks experienced during the Asian Financial Crisis in 1998 as well as to accommodate a shift in corporate borrowing from banks to the capital markets.</p><p>“Currently, household debt still accounts for a hefty 55% of the banking sector's loan book in 2011, up from an estimated 33% in 1998,” it noted.</p><p>On that score, the rating agency said it was encouraging to note that the central bank had prescribed prudent lending guidelines, which took effect in January, to ensure that banks give out loans only to those who are eligible, in order to avoid future distress in the household sector.</p><p>Similar guidelines had also been prescribed to DFIs, cooperatives and <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=MBSB\" target=\"_blank\">MALAYSIA BUILDING SOCIETY BHD</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=MBSB\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a> (MBSB), partially relieving the rating agency's anxiety about over-lending practices by non-banking institutions.</p><p>However, aside from the DFIs, these entities remain outside the regulatory purview of the central bank and may not necessarily adhere strictly to the credit standards established for the banking sector, it said, adding that nor would they have the and systems or experienced credit personnel to quickly meet the same credit standards.</p><p>As such, it continued to remain concerned over the quality and quantity of loans extended by these institutions and the resulting vulnerability of households, it noted.</p><p>MARC also maintained its belief that household deposits with the banking sector were a better indicator than household sector financial assets due to income inequalities that cause variations in the level of financial asset ownership among households of different income levels.</p><p>As a result of this inequality, it said the household sector financial assets to household sector debt ratio of 230% in 2011 (2010: 238%;  2009: 240%) is of limited use to measure the household sector's underlying financial asset cover.</p><p>The rating agency was still holding to its recommendations of prudential regulations that could possibly be deployed by the central bank to curb household debt. This include stricter loan-to-value (LTV) ratios on the purchase of a second residential property (if such purchases are made within a specific time period), a further increase in capital charge in the computation of risk weighted assets (in areas which may be perceived to be at risk of a developing property bubble) and maximum portfolio concentration limits for certain classes of lending such as unsecured personal lending and credit card advances.</p><p>For this year, MARC's GDP growth projection was 4.4% while its forecast for 2013 stands at 5%. The central bank was targeting a GDP growth rate of between 4% and 5% this year.</p>\n",

Home loans remained the largest component, contributing about 45% of the total household debt, she added.</p><p>However, unsecured financing in the form of personal loans and credit-cards had been growing rapidly, accounting for about 15% and 5% of total household debt, respectively.</p><p>Development financial institutions, cooperatives and building societies that offer personal financing facilities to civil servants under salary-deduction schemes contributed to the bulk of the growth, she noted.</p><p>“We view positively Bank Negara’s various pre-emptive measures implemented since late 2010 to rein in growth in household debt and safeguard the soundness of the financial system.</p><p>“On top of the tighter measures on residential property financing, stricter guidelines have also been implemented on credit cards, such as increasing the income eligibility criteria.</p><p>“We do not discount additional prudential regulations to be imposed in future,” Wong said.</p><p>Effective Jan 1, banks are required to use net income calculation method instead of gross income when computing debt-service ratio.</p><p>Wong added that unemployment rate was still relatively low at 3% and the credit quality of household sector was also healthy, with a low gross impaired-loan ratio of 1.8% as at end-January 2012 (end-2010:2.3%).</p><p>Nevertheless, she said the debt-servicing ability of households in the lower-income segment might be more vulnerable to economic down-cycles, greater variability in income and inflationary pressures.</p><p>On loan growth, RAM Ratings expects the overall banking system’s loan growth to taper to about 8% to 9% this year, after clocking in a strong 14% expansion in 2011. This is supported by a projected 4.6% real GDP growth this year, which is slightly lower than the 5% in 2011.</p><p>Private investments, she said were expected to remain strong, although a weakening in global demand would have some bearing on export performance.</p><p>Wong anticipates the central bank to remain accommodative in its monetary policy by maintaining the overnight policy rate at 3% with a downside bias in 2012, as preserving growth momentum would take precedence over curbing inflationary pressures.</p><p>While a more moderate household loan growth was anticipated due to the prudential regulations introduced, she added this would be balanced by stronger financing demand from the commercial and corporate sector from the rollout of projects under the Economic Transformation Programme and 10th Malaysia Plan.</p><p>For non-performing loans this year, she said the industry’s gross impaired-loan ratio was expected to be kept healthy this year, with a slight uptick to about 3% from the current all time low level of 2.7%.</p><p>“In terms of capitalisation, all the domestic, all the domestic banks were well poised to meet the new capital requirements under Basel III, of which the implementation would be phased in from 2013,” she added.</p><p>Although these new capital measures would elevate banks’ funding costs, which may in turn be passed on to consumers, it would ensure the banking sector was safeguarded against unexpected shocks, Wong said.</p><p>As at end-January, the banking system’s capitalisation was strong with a tier-1 risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio of 12.9%.</p><p>Banks’ profitability, she said had been on a steady rise over the last couple of years on the back of strong loan growth, benign loan impairment charges and growing fee income. However, net interest margins (NIMs) had been under pressure due to stiff price competition, particularly in certain loan segments such as residential mortgages.</p><p>NIM is a measure of the difference between interest income generated by banks and interest paid out to depositors.</p>\n",

      "<p>PETALING JAYA: The Audit Oversight Board (AOB) has flexed its regulatory muscles in a surprising way when it shortened the tenure of registration for three partners of two accounting firms from the usual one year to six months. Although by no means the harshest action that the board can take, this reduction of the validity period of registration serves notice that the work of auditors of large companies is indeed under greater scrutiny than before.</p><p>This measure came after the board's inspection last year of the country's six biggest audit firms  PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, Ernst &amp; Young, Deloitte, BDO and Crowe Horwath. Two of the three partners are from Crowe Horwath, while the third is from Ernst &amp; Young. They were registered for six months instead of 12 because the AOB found certain shortcomings while reviewing the audit jobs in which the trio were involved as engagement partners.</p><p>(An audit engagement partner is the person responsible for the performance of an audit and for the audit report issued after the work is done.)</p><p>The rationale for the shorter registration tenure for the three individual auditors is so that they will go through an earlier re-evaluation than the rest, to determine if there are improvements in the audits under their watch.</p><p>Under the Section 31S of the Securities Commission Act 1993, the period of registration with the AOB or the renewal is for 12 months, but the board has the discretion to specify otherwise.</p><p>AOB executive chairman Nik Mohd Hasyudeen Yusoff said the decision to halve the registration period for the auditors was based on its observations during the inspections of their firms last year.</p><p>He added: “We feel that we need to send a signal that the auditors must improve themselves. We want the firms to be very serious about maintaining audit quality. We shortened the registration period because we are timing the next inspections to happen before the respective six-month period is up. We will look at their job performance, and if they have improved, we will put them back on the normal arrangements.”</p><p>On why the AOB focused on the partners instead of their firms, he explained that the board's inspections showed that the firms had put in place the required process and controls. “The other part is when the individual auditors perform their work. As engagement partners, they take responsibility. From our viewpoint and after deliberation at the board level, this is the right measure to take in these particular situations based on the facts of these cases. If we had felt that the issues were more of a systemic nature, we would have looked at the firms,” he said.</p><p>He pointed out that shortcomings identified in the inspections related to non-compliance with some aspects of the international auditing standards in the performance of the relevant audits, but these did not invalidate the audit opinions expressed on the financial statements.</p><p>Crowe Horwath Malaysia managing partner Poon Yew Hoe said the firm had 20 partners. The registration of all of them were renewed accordingly, except for the two whose registration were renewed for six months.</p><p>“We are not aware of any specific reasons for the six-month renewal and will be working closely with the AOB to ensure all our partners remain registered with the board at all times. As integrity remains one of our core values, Crowe Horwath is committed to observing and adopting the highest level of auditing and ethical standards,” he added.</p><p>In a statement issued to StarBizWeek, Ernst &amp; Young said it welcomed the findings and comments in the AOB's inaugural annual report released on March 31. Added the firm: “The AOB has acknowledged that the audit firms inspected had put in place systems and procedures in line with global best practices. However, there are some specific areas for improvement.”</p><p>However, the firm declined to comment on the six-month renewal of its partner's registration, pending clarification from the AOB.</p><p>The AOB commenced operations on April 1 last year and immediately began registering audit firms and individual auditors. At the year-end, 83 firms and 310 individual auditors were on the board's register of auditors.</p><p>The six firms covered in last year's inspections were chosen because they collectively audited 73% of the public interest entities (PIEs) in Malaysia, while their listed clients accounted for 93% of the total market capitalisation of the companies on Bursa Malaysia. PIEs include listed companies, banking and financial institutions (including Islamic banks and development financial institutions), insurance companies and takaful operators, and holders of Capital Market Services Licences (such as securities and futures trading firms, and fund management companies).</p><p>This year, the AOB plans to inspect the six largest firms again, plus 12 others.</p>\n",

      "<p>PETALING JAYA: Financial institutions believe that personal financing, although on the rise, is not a cause for concern as it still constitutes a lesser segment of the total household debt.</p><p>RHB Bank Bhd acting director of retail banking Vince Au Yoong told StarBiz that although personal financing expanded by 29.4% last year, the outstanding balance accounted for less than 5% of total household debts.</p><p>“Additionally, almost half of the household debts were from long term secured borrowings to fund house acquisitions of about 46.2% in 2009,” he said.</p><p>Personal loan, as one of the components of household debts, has a been a topic of concern among some economists who worry that growth seen in consumer spending may have been a result of debt instead of income growth.</p><p>Personal loans was up 14.3% in March from a year ago and 1.9% higher than February.</p><p>Last year, according to Bank Negara, outstanding personal financing grew by 17.5% to account for 14.6% of household debt, compared with 9.6% in 2006.</p><p>It was reported that development financial institutions, cooperatives and building societies constitute the bulk of this growth, with almost 80% granted under salary deduction schemes.</p><p>Meanwhile, OCBC Bank (M) Bhd country chief risk officer Choo Yee Kwan said typical of emerging or newly emerging economies, rising wealth of the working population might bring about a rise in household debt, of which the key components would very likely be housing and transportation-related needs.</p><p>“Although on the uptrend, personal financing constitutes a relatively lesser segment of the nation's total household debt,” he said.</p><p><a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=MBSB\" target=\"_blank\">MALAYSIA BUILDING SOCIETY BHD</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=MBSB\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a> (MBSB) chief executive officer Datuk  Ahmad Zaini Othman said the rise of personal financing reflected that more customers were in need of cash to meet their personal financial needs.</p><p>“We must look at the rising costs of living, costs of goods and services, costs of medical, education and others. We must then compare that to the low incremental of wages over the years.</p><p>“Simply, the growth rate of household income has been lower than that of household expenditure over the last few decades.</p><p>“Hence, customers are left with no options but to take personal financing to meet non-recurring expenditure such as their parents' medical fees and hospitalisation, children's education, house improvements and long term retail investments.</p><p>“As long as financial institutions continue to provide responsible lending to financially qualified customers, this may not be a critical concern,” he said.</p><p>Ahmad Zaini also pointed out that up until 2009, MBSB had only been disbursing a monthly average of RM15mil of personal financing, hence, the statement that building societies' was a key contributor to the growth of personal financing (since 2006) was inaccurate.</p><p>“The cooperatives on the other hand have been able to provide a significant amount of personal financing to their members/government servants due to their collaborations over the years with the commercial banks.</p><p>“The commercial banks are actually the financiers,” he said.</p><p>On demand and promotions of personal loans have been getting more competitive of late, Au Yong said previously there was a big group of those under-served, where financing was not easily accessible.</p><p>“As a result, they have to obtain financing from private enterprises or unorganised groups who charge exorbitant rates as this group were perceived as high risks.</p><p>“But, with robust risk management tools, banks are able to better serve this huge segment. On top of this, customers are able to build their credit history that will help them to obtain better pricing in the future,” he said.</p><p>Going forward, Au Yong said personal loan was one of the bank's key retail products.</p><p>“We have a strong demand for this product and the overall portfolio is performing well. Hence, we will continue to offer personal loans in the marketplace,” he said.</p><p>Choo said with the positive economic outlook this year and OCBC's strong capital position, its risk appetite remained intact and would invest in good business propositions to grow its loan book.</p><p>“Personal loans provide an alternative to other personal financial management tools such as credit cards and overdraft facilities, which offer different platforms for customers to manage their spending and credit needs prudently, within their means of repayment,” he said.</p><p>Ahmad Zaini said MBSB aimed to achieve loan growth in all its existing products including personal financing.</p><p>“The customers are certainly appreciative of very affordable financing being offered resulting in the good response received, hence to deny or limit the access will only result in unfavourable circumstances for them.</p><p>“It may also cause them to turn to unlicensed parties for financing,” he said.</p><p>Related Stories:  Amended Act likely to affect used car sales   Govt's active role in social housing vital   Small impact seen after banks' rates rise</p>\n",

      "<p>THE banking landscape, which has gone through considerable reform and consolidation, is set for exciting changes  again. This time, it will be driven by bigger players that aim, through a market-driven process, to gain further strength and traction as competition intensifies.</p><p>With the process of liberalisation well under way, the competition comes from all sides as different sets of players emerge. Apart from the fight in the traditional retail market, new entrants are tapping the global, commercial, Islamic, wholesale and investment banking space.</p><p>On the corporate level, bank mergers and acquisitions are coming alive again with Hong Leong Bank leading the charge through its recent acquisition of EON Bank.</p><p>In fact, a number of bank stakes are up for sale. Dubbed banking consolidation round three, the resulting combinations will be keenly watched.</p><p>   M&amp;A scenarios</p><p>The hottest deal now is the sale of the 25% stake held by the Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB) in <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=RHBBANK\" target=\"_blank\">RHB Capital Bhd</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=RHBBANK\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a>. So far, three to four parties have submitted their bids for the stake for which the asking price is said to be around two times book value or RM10 per share.</p><p>At RHB, the talk on M&amp;A revolves around two elements  sale of the ADCB stake and even RHB itself.</p><p>Speculation on a possible RHB/CIMB merger has resurfaced. It was first mentioned as part of a game plan when CIMB took over Southern Bank Bhd, and RHB was seen as the next potential takeover target for CIMB.</p><p>The rumours on a possible RHB/CIMB merger were stoked following a recent statement by CIMB chief Datuk Seri Nazir Razak on its ambition to be among the top three in Asia in terms of market capitalisation.</p><p>No doubt there will be duplication in the investment and corporate banking business, but that is seen to be the fastest route to the top among Malaysian banks in terms of market capitalisation.</p><p>Some analysts consider CIMB to be strong enough to do another merger, following its merger with Southern Bank five to six years ago.</p><p>The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) which holds a 45% stake in RHB Capital, will be looking at a compelling price and reason to sell, having put the bank on a firmer foothold and doubled its profits.</p><p>Another statement that had the market talking was the Prime Minister's statement that he might consider a higher stake in <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=AMBANK\" target=\"_blank\">AMMB HOLDINGS BHD</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=AMBANK\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a> by the Australia New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) which currently has a 24% stake.</p><p>“There's no smoke without a fire.'' says an analyst. Reports had speculated that AMMB chairman Tan Sri Azman Hashim, who indirectly holds a 17% stake, may be looking to sell out.</p><p>The limit on foreign shareholding in banks is 30% but applications for stakes exceeding that threshold may be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>ANZ is reported to be one of the potential bidders for the ADCB block; if ANZ succeeds in buying a stake in RHB, it would need to merge AMMB with RHB, analysts noted.</p><p>Another potential M&amp;A may be from the <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=AFG\" target=\"_blank\">Alliance Financial Group</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=AFG\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a> (AFG), whose strategic shareholder, Langkah Bahagia, is looking to exit. Langkah Bahagia effectively owns 14.8% of AFG via Vertical Theme which is a joint venture between Langkah Bahagia (51%) and Temasek (41%) that collectively owns 29% of AFG.</p><p>DBS is reported to be another bidder for the stake in ADCB. If it does buy into RHB Capital, AFG could be merged with RHB or Temasek could sell off its stake in AFG.  </p><p>Push factors</p><p>The relatively saturated domestic banking market is a natural push factor for larger banks to sustain and expand their dominance locally, notes Malaysian Rating Corp Bhd (MARC) vice-president and head of financial institution ratings Anandakumar Jegarasasingam.</p><p>As for smaller banks, consolidation within themselves will help to ensure such an exercise takes place on their own terms.</p><p>“The business of banking has evolved into one where economies of scale in funding and lending activities is of great importance, thus acquisitions are preferred over organic growth by those seeking to enlarge their franchise,'' he says.</p><p>“Ambitions of certain banking groups to achieve regional flagship status require the creation of a stronger domestic franchise that can, in turn, support their regional ventures,'' he explains.</p><p>Thinning margins also force banks to look for efficiencies; in Malaysia, the margin is said to be around 3% compared with Singapore (2.5%) and Indonesia (5%).</p><p>Yvonne Chia, group managing director of Hong Leong Bank, expects the fight for profitable market segments to intensify in Malaysia.</p><p>“The banks will need to address the challenging task of adopting risk-based pricing along Basle lines in a very liquid and low interest rate environment where the price war remains unabated,'' she tells StarBizWeek.</p><p>The war for talent is unrelenting and will continue. Return on shareholders' funds of banks is increasingly under pressure with additional  capital  requirements under Basle 2/3.</p><p>“The need for scale efficiency, fee income, balance sheet and capital strength and deposit liquidity further powers the shift to consolidate, to capitalise on combined market coverage, talent and benefits of scale.</p><p>“Additional scale allows investment and encourage innovative business models to serve evolving market needs.  In essence, it allows already successful franchises to take the business to the next level,'' says Chia.   </p><p>Too big to fail?</p><p>Many who recall big banks in the West crashing during the recent financial crisis will ask: “When will they ever learn that big is not always beautiful?''</p><p>In fact, big banks may be less nimble and innovative. In extreme cases, their formation may lead to cartelisation, to the detriment of consumers.</p><p>However, that tendency could be limited as banks compete heavily against each other, an analyst points out. While in the area of mortgage loans, the rates are getting cheaper, it is noted that rates for credit cards stay consistently high among all the banks.</p><p>Analysts caution against systemic risk if the largest banks merge to form banks that can be deemed “too big to fail”.</p><p>“In the US, that threshold is 10% of loans. However,  in the Malaysian context, there is already a high concentration of assets in the largest banks in Malaysia,'' says an analyst.</p><p>However, in the consolidation process, Bank Negara would be in a position to decide which mergers are in the best interest of the banking sectors and the economy in general, he adds.</p><p>Analysts view that consolidation generally results in better pricing, cheaper cost of funds as well as product reach.</p><p>As margins narrow with higher competition, banks are likely to come up with more products to earn more money, thus giving better choices to consumers.</p><p>“If the partner and chemistry are right, the M&amp;A can work,'' says an analyst, pointing to the two major ones that have worked  CIMB and Southern Bank in the retail space; the tie-up between AMMB with ANZ has resulted in profitability.</p><p>In some instances, for example, the card business, the merger between CIMB and Southern Bank has seen improved service levels, says an analyst.</p><p>“Eventually, there will be probably four or five banking groups,'' says Tan Sri Azlan Zainol, chairman of RHB Bank. “The consolidation will be driven by those with strong capital base, strong shareholders and the need to expand regionally.''</p><p>The management should not be restricted to just local talent. “We need the best,'' Azlan says. “We should not be too restrictive but look into hiring foreigners.''</p><p>According to  Jegarasasingam, there is considerable fragmentation of market share among the smaller banks, with the three large local banks accounting for nearly 40%-45% of assets in the Malaysian banking sector.</p><p>The three small local banks (including EON Bank, which has since been acquired by Hong Leong Bank) account for only 7%-8% of banking sector assets.</p><p>Consolidation of Hong Leong and EON Bank will enable both groups to reach out to a larger customer base and most segments, with a broader range of products, services and solutions to reach out to over 300 branches and 1,200 self-service terminals.</p><p>“With the combined Hong Leong/EON Bank, we reassert our strong position in the retail segment. For the business segment, we have doubled up our market share, making us a more pre-eminent player. Internally, it will augment career opportunities for our employees with a larger and growing Hong Leong group riding on strong growth ambitions,'' Chia tells StarBizWeek.</p><p>The customer will also benefit as evolving market trends that include mass adoption of portable devices, mobile interaction and social networks point to the need to offer more relevant, integrated and seamless solutions and offerings.</p><p>   Not a shrinking pie</p><p>Consolidation usually refers to shrinkage. And while the local pie is shrinking via this consolidation process, licences are issued to a host of global, commercial and Islamic banks from overseas.</p><p>According to Chia, these moves to consolidate and at the same time, expand certain niches, are specifically targeted.</p><p>“There are new segments that are under-served and a need to cater for the changes arising from Asean integration as well as the rise of India and China as more important trading partners.</p><p>In the investment banking space, the expansion from universal broker status has led to the creation of six non-bank backed investment banks alongside the existing nine bank-backed arms.</p><p>According to U Chen Hock, CEO of OSK Investment Bank, finding its own niche and achieving scale through regional operations is a primary way to sustain this new growth area.</p><p>The setting up of new Islamic banks also represented another dynamic growth area in the banking sector.</p><p>About 30 new banking franchises have been created and these include locally incorporated foreign banks, investment banks, Islamic banks and international Islamic banks, says Promod Das, head of financial institution ratings at RAM Ratings.</p><p>The regional theme will ensure expansion in businesses overseas. A few Malaysian banks are already making significant headways to seek growth outside Malaysia to tap the Asean growth and integration.</p><p>“Regional and cross-border investment, trade, foreign exchange and wealth flows will further accelerate the regionalisation imperative,'' says Chia.</p><p>Expansion in the banking sector is also via the e-equation' of mobile and online banking.</p><p>“The next generation of consumers expect easier and faster access to financial information with many expecting 24 /7, ubiquitous access.</p><p>“Providing digital age offerings will come under the spotlight and will redefine customer engagement and relationship management for the banking industry,'' says Chia of Hong Leong.</p><p>Datuk Seri Abdul Wahid Omar, president and CEO of Maybank, does not see these two trends  consolidation and expansion  as contradictory.</p><p>“The need for the banking industry to expand will be there as long as consumer and business demand grow to expand the economy and in turn it is the banking sector that also drives the economy,'' he says.</p><p>As Malaysia becomes a developed economy, it is the larger banks with their economies of scale and scope that will have the ability to provide a wider range of products and services at a lower cost.</p><p>“For this to happen, the industry will have to go through a consolidation phase where banks will grow not just organically but through acquisition of smaller banks,'' says Wahid.</p><p>The major issue is ensuring that the right banks are merged; there must be a business fit that complements each other with as little duplication as possible. Reducing this duplication will take time, given that retrenchments or relocation of employees could have regulatory restrictions as seen in the previous consolidation of 1999-2002, where banks were not allowed to retrench staff for two years following a merger.</p><p>“Experience has shown that banks can often see a decline in productivity upon a merger and in practice, mergers can take two to three years before they become value accretive, depending also on the valuation of the acquisition.</p><p>“In the interim, if investors see greater value elsewhere, the resulting depressed share price could have negative implications. for example, in raising capital,'' says an analyst.</p><p>Another issue for smaller banks in attracting foreign banks to become a strategic partner is that the limit on foreign shareholding could be a hindrance although this could be resolved on a case by case basis as indicated by Bank Negara.</p><p>Jegarasasingam of MARC cautions against small Malaysian banks from expanding into regional markets, which are generally risky and complex to manage.</p><p>In consolidation exercises, heavy competition among potential acquirers may, at times, result in a sub-standard due diligence exercise arising from the eagerness to close the deal ahead of competitors, he says.</p><p>”Any merger or acquisition should not merely be driven by attractive pricing. Such deals should also be evaluated in terms of the potential value proposition and the effort required for extracting results out of the deal.'' he adds.   </p><p>Future direction</p><p>With so many measures taken to boost Islamic banking, repositioning the banking system in the competitive global arena as the international Islamic financial centre has become a priority, says Promod.</p><p>He also expects some relaxation of foreign equity ownership in domestic banks, removal of some existing restrictions on locally incorporated foreign banks and the issuances of more licences that will encourage competition.</p><p>Currently, commercial and investment banking businesses are held under different legal entities in a universal banking group, he notes.</p><p>“There may be more flexibility to remove these regulatory walls in search of administrative efficiency.</p><p>“Bank Negara's next financial sector blueprint might also create regulatory and market undercurrents to consolidate the role of financial co-operatives and development financial institutions, an area which was not prioritised in the last financial sector master plan,' he says.</p><p>Promod does not discount the possibility of a shake-out in the stand-alone investment banking space.</p><p>“There clearly has emerged a huge gap in franchise between the large investment banking powerhouses that are part of universal banking groups and their much smaller stand-alone rivals.</p><p>“This fiercely competitive space naturally does not favour smaller players,'' he says.</p><p>Datuk Charon Wardini Mokhzani, corporate and investment banking deputy CEO of the <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=CIMB\" target=\"_blank\">CIMB Group</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=CIMB\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a>, however, feels there is room for different types of investment banks on a growing capital market.</p><p>Related Stories:  Little impact from foreign banking players   Challenge to sustain investment banking   Job creation and shortage of staff in financial services sector   More M&amp;As seen in insurance and takaful </p>\n",

      "<p>A lot is riding on the sturdiness of the Audit Oversight Board framework</p><p>WHOSE fault is it if the quality and reliability of audited financial statements in Malaysia suffer because the audit fees don't correspond to the amount and nature of work required to do a good job? This mismatch is a common complaint among the auditors. We often hear them lamenting that the fees in Malaysia are on the low side. For an example of this, read our Up Close &amp; Personal interview with KPMG Malaysia managing partner Mohamed Raslan Abdul Rahman on page 6.</p><p>The maiden annual report of the Audit Oversight Board (AOB), issued on Thursday, has amplified the issue. When highlighting the key findings from its inspections of the six largest audit firms in the country, the board points out that auditors need to price their services at levels that will ensure that they can comply with the requirements of auditing and ethical standards. The worry here is that firms may decide on the resources to be deployed for audit engagements based on the fees they will earn rather than on the risks that need to be addressed when auditing the accounts.</p><p>In its annual report, the AOB relays the grouse of audit firms that “due to the relatively low audit fees in Malaysia, it is a big challenge for them to secure adequate resources”. Considering that the AOB was set up to assist the Securities Commission in regulating auditors of public interest entities (PIEs), it's telling that the board saw this matter as worthy of a mention. But does this mean that the authorities agree that the auditors are not being paid enough for their services?</p><p>If you're bent on getting an unambiguous answer to that, good luck to you. The board will only go as far as to emphasise that the fees should be properly tied to the audit work that ought to be done. It says in the annual report: “The AOB is mindful that the global economy is still in a recovery stage. This will continue to place pressure on PIEs to contain their operating costs, including audit fees. Nevertheless, the AOB expects auditors to price their fees to commensurate with the risks undertaken so as not to compromise on audit quality.”</p><p>PIEs include listed companies, banking and financial institutions (including Islamic banks and development financial institutions), insurance companies and takaful operators, and holders of Capital Market Services Licences (such as securities and futures trading firms, and fund management companies).</p><p>When fielding questions from reporters after releasing the report, AOB executive chairman Mohamed Nik Hasyudeen Yusoff stopped short of endorsing the view that companies in Malaysia should get used to the idea of paying higher audit fees. He said the board would not tell the firms what to charge clients and would leave this to the market forces to decide. Instead, he urged companies to look at audit fees as an investment rather than as a cost, because the work of auditors supports the enhancement of a company's value.</p><p>To help audit firms in determining fees, the Malaysian Institute of Accountants have something called A Guide To Charging For Professional Assurance Services. It says: “Fee arrangement is a matter for commercial negotiation by practitioners. The Institute does not prescribe the mandatory basis for calculating fees, nor does it ordinarily investigate complaints relating solely to the quantum of fees charged.</p><p>“The level of fee is to be mutually agreed between the auditor and his client, which largely depends upon the skill and knowledge required, level of training and experience of the staff involved, the time necessarily occupied and the degree of responsibility and urgency of work involved.</p><p>“However, this RPG (recommended practice guide) is useful as a benchmark to establish the reasonable level of remuneration, commensurate with the provision of professional services of an acceptable and recognised standard in the absence of other more sophisticated billing methodology.”</p><p>The problem is, not many firms make full use of the RPG. Hence, we continue to hear the auditors' grumbling about the fees. Perhaps their best hope is that the AOB framework will bring about desirable changes.</p><p>The strategy here is that the AOB inspections will compel the firms to improve their compliance with the standards, and consequently, the firms will turn to their clients and say: “Look, we'll get into trouble with the regulators if our audit work falls short of the requirements of the standards. We won't cut corners and we won't reduce the scope of the work. Our fees have to be right-sized. If you don't want to pay that much, find auditors who are willing to risk being slapped with sanctions by the AOB.”</p><p>Of course, such a transition in mindset will take time. Meanwhile, let's see how the AOB handles the errant firms that has no qualms about bending the rules to fit the fees. The annual report has this to say: “It has been a known area of concern that the provision of non-audit services by audit firms to their listed audit clients may result in auditors low-balling their audit fees to gain more consulting jobs at clients and this may compromise independence. The AOB will be reviewing the safeguards in place to understand how the threats are mitigated.” Again, who should we blame for low-quality audits?</p><p> Deputy executive editor Errol Oh believes that many people don't understand what is it that auditors really do.</p>\n",

      "<p>KUALA LUMPUR: The Audit Oversight Board (AOB) has pinpointed “a number of shortcomings” after inspecting the country's six largest audit firms last year. This raises the possibility of the board finding more areas of concern when it widens its inspection coverage to include smaller firms this year.</p><p>AOB executive chairman Nik Mohd Hasyudeen Yusoff said the board was targeting to inspect 18 audit firms this year, including mid-tier and small firms. “We will have a better picture of where everybody is in the (financial reporting) ecosystem,” he told reporters after the release of the AOB's maiden annual report yesterday.</p><p>He described the inspections and the resulting remediation as the most important part of the board's work. “This is where we try to influence the quality of audit, when we understand where the firms are lacking and where they can improve,” he said.</p><p>Last year, the AOB used a risk-based approach to select the six firms for inspection. These firms are the Big Four (PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, Ernst &amp; Young and Deloitte) and two others with more than 10 partners. The board did not name the latter, but according to its Register of Auditors, BDO and Crowe Horwath are the only firms apart from the Big Four that have more than 10 partners.</p><p>Nik Mohd Hasyudeen said these firms collectively audited 73% of the public interest entities (PIEs) in Malaysia, while their listed clients accounted for 93% of the total market capitalisation of the companies on Bursa Malaysia. PIEs include listed companies, banking and financial institutions (including Islamic banks and development financial institutions), insurance companies and takaful operators, and holders of Capital Market Services Licences (such as securities and futures trading firms, and fund management companies).</p><p>Said Nik Mohd Hasyudeen: “We have decided that the six firms will continue be inspected annually because of the impact of their work, whereas the others will each be inspected every three years. But that depends on what we find during the inspections, because we may have to conduct follow-up inspections.”</p><p>In his message in the annual report, he wrote: “While we determined that the audit firms inspected had put in place systems and processes in line with global best practices, some specific areas for improvements were identified. The AOB will follow up on the remediation efforts of the audit firms to ensure substantive changes are effected to enhance audit quality.”</p><p>The report said the inspections had identified a number of shortcomings that needed to be addressed by the firms, particularly in the area of audit documentation and evidence for significant judgement areas.</p><p>“If a firm doesn't document its work, there is no basis for us to confirm that the firm has performed its function. One of the principles that we have adopted in our inspections is that if you fail to document, we will consider that you have not done the audit procedure. This is a very strong position that we have taken,” added Nik Mohd Hasyudeen.</p><p>Said the AOB in the annual report: “Other than instances where there was insufficient documentation for the audit evidence obtained, there were instances where the necessary audit procedures and evidence were clearly not performed or obtained. It is pertinent to recognise that without sufficient evidence and analysis, the auditor may not have a basis to support their opinion.”</p><p>The board also called on the auditors to be more robust and to apply professional scepticism in challenging management assumptions and estimates, particularly in areas that require significant professional judgement such as in determining fair value, asset impairment and going concern.</p><p>He said these were highly subjective areas and pointed out that the value of the audit work came from the auditors exercising professional scepticism to objectively and independently arrive at audit opinions.</p><p>Another key observation by the AOB following last year's inspections was the need for audit firms to price their services at levels that commensurated with the risks undertaken so as not to compromise on audit quality.</p><p>The annual report also highlighted that human resource was an important factor in ensuring high quality audit, including ensuring appropriate workload of partners and other members of the audit team, as well as attracting new talent through a conducive work environment.</p><p>Nik Mohd Hasyudeen said the board had yet to determine if the issues uncovered in last year's inspection would lead to inquiries and possible sanctions. He explained: “Our main focus is to work with the firms on remediation. That is very critical. If we have identified areas for improvement, we need to get that resolved immediately rather than to prolong the situation. Given that we just completed the inspections in December, we are still looking at a number of issues. If we were to impose sanctions, we will be transparent.”</p>\n",

      "<p>THE build-up of household debt has been a topic that has generated much discussion in recent months and years.</p><p>Yes, the numbers do show household debt as a percentage of GDP rising and at the end of last year it was 75.9%. The worry is that it is the largest percentage rise in Asia and the memory of the consequences of uncontrolled build-up has been displayed in South Korea, where the unravelling of its credit card debt sent the economy southward.</p><p>Working in favour of the economy is that the debt build-up has been supported by household assets, which is more than twice that of total household debt.</p><p>Full employment, the high savings of Malaysians and low non-performing loans of household debt adds to the cushion for the regulator in assessing the overall situation with household debt and the potential systemic risk it poses.</p><p>In Bank Negara governor's statement in the Financial Stability and Payment Systems Report 2010, Tan Sri Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz says that while household indebtedness has increased in the recent years, it has continued to be supported by strong financial buffers at the aggregate level.</p><p>“Income growth, the high savings rate and favourable employment conditions have contributed to supporting the debt servicing capacity of households,” she says in her statement.</p><p>“To ensure that this does not become a source of financial instability, a comprehensive series of policies were introduced during the course of the year. These include prudential policies applied in the residential property sector, new credit card measures and strengthened requirements for banks to adopt prudent and responsible lending practices. This was reinforced by more intensive supervisory oversight of financial institutions with respect to the management of household lending portfolios,” she says.</p><p>The governor adds in her statement that more targeted financial education programmes as well as advisory and support arrangements have also served to promote responsible borrowing by households. These pre-emptive and more holistic measures also aim to contribute towards further strengthening the resilience of the household sector.</p><p>The central bank uses the Financial Stability Policy Committee, a forum that assess risks to financial stability.</p><p>The Financial Stability Policy Committee also works with the Monetary Policy Committee, which sets the overnight policy rate, in coming up with macroprudential responses for the economy.</p><p>Some examples how those committees have worked together has been the recent steps taken to put some brakes in household debt and consumption credit.</p><p>The central bank last year had imposed a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 70% for people wanting to buy their third or more homes.</p><p>Latest data do indicate demand for housing loans is starting to cool. Banks are paying more attention to applications of borrowers to weed out speculative borrowing but the impact will only be known in the March data to see if the drop is seasonal like it is at the beginning of any year.</p><p>The next measure Bank Negara took was to raise the minimum income limit to RM24,000 per annum for people to be eligible for a credit card. It is also limiting the number of credit cards to two for people earning less than RM36,000 a year.</p><p>The reason for worry for credit cards stemmed from the growing use of credit for transaction purposes.</p><p>Bank Negara says that despite a reduction in the number of cards owned by households following the imposition of a RM50 fee by the Government on credit cards in 2010, outstanding credit card balances increased by 15.2% to RM30.8bil at the end of last year to account for 5.3% of household debts. It further says that outstanding balances per credit card holder rose by 15.1% to RM9,516 as at end-2010.</p><p>“The number of credit card holders with revolving balances (excluding defaulters) accounted for 47.9% of total credit card holders. More than half of credit card holders with revolving balances were those earning an annual income of RM36,000 and below,” it says in the report.</p><p>Meanwhile, the level of non-performing loans (NPLs) ratio for credit cards issued by banks and non-banks remained low at 1.7%.</p><p>The next step Bank Negara is taking is to stress-test individual borrowers to gauge if they can afford a new loan once new guidelines are introduced in the third quarter of this year.</p><p>The new guidelines are designed to inculcate responsible lending practices by financial institutions when dealing with retail customers where borrowers will be subject to a suitability and affordability assessment and verification of income.</p><p>The reason for that is while there are education programmes to inform young borrowers about getting into debt and how to manage their finances, clamps need to be also put in place because the last thing anyone wants is a homegrown sub-prime crisis.</p><p>In tackling the affordability angle, one area where consumption credit in still left unchecked and unregulated is personal financing from development financial institutions (DFIs), cooperatives and building societies.</p><p>While a large fraction of household borrowings is collateralised, as 45.3% of such financing was for the purchase of residential properties, personal financing has increased significantly in recent periods.</p><p>Bank Negara says in 2010, outstanding personal financing grew by 17.5% to account for 14.6% of household debt (2006: 9.6%). DFIs, co-ops and building societies accounted for the bulk of this growth, with almost 80% granted under salary deduction schemes.</p><p>“Given the salary deduction feature, credit assessments by these institutions are mostly limited to a reliance on incomplete computations of debt-servicing ratios, which are applied for the purpose of qualifying for the salary deduction facility,” the central bank says. “The absence of robust credit and affordability assessments will result in households being more at risk of becoming over-indebted, while the risk of defaulting on financing obligations, including those obtained from other banking institutions, will be higher for borrowers who have over-borrowed.”</p><p>The central bank says excluding the DFIs, personal financing exposures of commercial banks increased at a lower rate of 13% to account for 8.6% of banking system household loans. Sound underwriting standards have largely been maintained by banks in terms of financing limits, tenures and pricing for these exposures.</p>\n",

      "<p>THE residential property market has been experiencing an upturn since the fourth quarter of 2009 as demand rebounded by 7.1% (2009: -2.3%) following improved consumer sentiments. Meanwhile, the increase in housing stock moderated in 2010 as housing started a declining trend.</p><p>The widening gap between supply and demand has kept property prices elevated, although at the national level, the Malaysian House Price Index rose only moderately by 6.2% up to the third quarter of 2010. Substantial increases in house prices had been observed in selected locations within and surrounding the urban areas where price increases were up to four times higher than the national house price index.</p><p>Price increases in these locations have in turn resulted in prices of properties in the surrounding locations to increase, making homeownership increasingly less affordable for the average Malaysian. There have also been incidents of applications for financing of multiple residential units within a single development project from a single borrower.</p><p>To address this development, borrowers are subjected to a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 70% for the third and subsequent house financing facilities with effect from Nov 3, 2010. This measure aims to promote a stable and sustainable property market by deterring speculative activity through higher equity requirements for transactions of these nature.</p><p>In January 2011, Bank Negara revised the risk weights applied under the capital adequacy framework from 75% to 100% for housing loans with LTVs exceeding 90% to further reinforce prudent underwriting practices.</p><p>While a large fraction of household borrowings was collateralised (45.3% was for the purchase of residential properties), personal financing had increased significantly as outstanding personal financing grew by 17.5% to account for 14.6% of household debt last year (2006: 9.6%).</p><p>Development financial institutions (DFIs), cooperatives and building societies accounted for the bulk of this growth, with almost 80% granted under salary-deduction schemes.

Meanwhile, the level of non-performing loan (NPL) ratio for credit cards issued by banks and non-banks remained low at 1.7%. To ensure that credit card debts are maintained at manageable levels, a number of pre-emptive measures have been introduced, including raising minimum income eligibility, limiting the number of credit card ownership and aggregate credit limit for those with annual income of RM36,000 and below.</p><p>Loans-in-arrears across most categories of household debts remained stable, while loans-in-arrears for personal financing, which drifted upwards in the early part of last year, started to come down in the fourth quarter of 2010. As at end-2010, the NPL ratio for household loans was 2.3%. The ratio of household loan repayment-to-disbursement increased marginally to 87.8%.</p><p>The highly-competitive environment and the increased indebtedness of households have called for pre-emptive measures to preserve the resilience of the household sector going forward. Although personal bankruptcies and relapse rate among borrowers under AKPK's Debt Management Programme have been manageable, they have been on the increase since 2007.</p><p>Several initiatives have been implemented during the year to ensure the continued resilience of the household sector, including a programme to educate younger and first-time borrowers on responsible borrowing, tighter standards for credit cards and enhanced requirements on the conduct of business by financial institutions in retail financing.</p><p>For Bank Negara statements click here</p>\n",

      "<p>PETALING JAYA: Five accounting firms were the first to run into trouble with the Audit Oversight Board (AOB) because they had accepted appointments last year as auditors of public interest entities (PIEs) without first registering with the board.</p><p>Three listed companies  <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=BTECH\" target=\"_blank\">Brite-Tech Bhd</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=BTECH\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a>, <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=CNASIA\" target=\"_blank\">CN Asia Corp Bhd</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=CNASIA\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a> and <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=MINTYE\" target=\"_blank\">Mintye Industries Bhd</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=MINTYE\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a>  were among those that had engaged these firms when it was illegal for them to act as auditors of PIEs.</p><p>After detecting these cases in its monitoring of the AGMs of PIEs, the AOB sent show-cause letters to the five firms, asking them to explain why they had failed to register with the board before agreeing to become auditors of the PIEs. However, because the regulatory framework for auditors was just introduced last April, the firms have been spared stiff penalties and are allowed to audit the financial statements of PIEs.</p><p>AOB executive chairman Nik Mohd Hasyudeen Yusoff said that the idea behind setting up the board was to ensure robust oversight of auditors. As such, it viewed any breach of law seriously.</p><p>He added that the AOB had dealt swiftly with the five firms and had sent “a very strong signal” that it would not tolerate such incidents in the future.</p><p>“Having considered the firms' explanations and considering that this is the first year that the new law is implemented, we issued warning letters to them. We also require them to do certain reporting to us on a periodical basis to make sure that they are in compliance with the law. They are now registered. These are issues that we faced at the early stage of implementing this new law,” he told StarBiz.</p><p>The Securities Commission Act 1993 was amended last year to provide for the establishment of the AOB and for related matters. Among other things, the new rules require that an auditor of a PIE be registered with the AOB. PIEs include listed companies, banking and financial institutions (including Islamic banks and development financial institutions), insurance companies and takaful operators, and holders of Capital Market Services Licences (such as securities and futures trading firms, and fund management companies).</p><p>The amendments came into effect on April Fools' Day last year, which was also the day the AOB commenced operations. This meant that auditors that were due to be reappointed in AGMs scheduled to be held in the first few days of April had to quickly register with the board.</p><p>Given that many of their audit clients are PIEs, the larger firms were naturally among the earliest to be registered. For example, Ernst &amp; Young (EY) and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) were registered on April 1 itself, while KPMG got into the AOB register of auditors on April 9.</p><p>Mohd Hasyudeen explained that the board could register EY and PwC on its first day because a lot of groundwork had been done earlier to ensure that the firms knew the criteria for registration and could thus submit applications with the necessary information and documentation.</p><p>He said: “We approved the applications (on April 1) because we were satisfied that they met the criteria. We were able to make these decisions because we had made all the preparations.”</p><p>Prior to April, the Securities Commission had made available the registration handbooks and forms, and had fielded enquiries about the registration process.</p><p>Another factor that figured in the AOB's speedy approval of registration applications was the need to avoid disruptions in the PIEs' appointment of auditors.</p><p>“AGMs had already been scheduled and we did not want to see companies having to postpone the meetings and incurring costs just because the auditors could not accept appointments after failing to register in time.</p><p>“We pre-empted all these issues to make sure there was a smooth transition and implementation. We are in the confidence-building business. News that companies have failed to appoint auditors may not be positive. So we cautiously manage that process,” Mohd Hasyudeen said.</p><p>For the board, there is an additional layer of assurance in the fact that a criterion for AOB registration is that the auditors must already be approved by the Finance Ministry under Section 8 of the Companies Act 1965. Under the Companies Act, the Finance Minister gives such an approval to a company auditor when satisfied that the applicant is “of good character and competent to perform the duties of an auditor under this Act”.</p><p>Mohd Hasyudeen pointed out that the registration process is not the only time that the auditors are subject to the AOB's scrutiny. “If the auditors are registered and subsequently we find that they have not been truthful to us  say, they have submitted misleading information or have omitted important information  we will act against them. That's why we conduct inspections of auditors,” he added.</p><p>The AOB declined to provide details of the five accounting firms that have been given warnings. However, by comparing announcements on the Bursa Malaysia website with the board's register of auditors, StarBiz has found that three firms had been appointed auditors of listed companies before they had been registered with the AOB (see table on B1). Another three were appointed on the same day their applications for registration were approved.</p><p>On the status of the latter three, Mohd Hasyudeen said: “We registered them because we were satisfied that they had fulfilled our requirements. We take it that they were each registered on that particular date.”</p>\n",

      "<p>THE inception of the SME Credit Bureau Sdn Bhd in 2008 has given hope to credible small and medium enterprises (SMEs) seeking funds to expand their operations. At the same time, it has spared financial institutions the burden of screening trustworthy and reliable ones for financing.</p><p>The current internal credit rating system used by banks to assess SMEs takes only a micro view in the sense that it rates only SME customers without having a wider picture or other pertinent information on the SME market.</p><p>This is where the Bureau steps in. It offers SME credit risk rating, business review and business information reports to banks and SMEs.</p><p>The credit risk rating, according to chief executive officer Alex Lim, is carried out after getting the relevant information data of SMEs and later conducting credit rating specifically for each SME to facilitate financing. Information is extracted, among others, from the Companies Commission of Malaysia and Bank Negara.</p><p>“By using the default probability model we can gauge the likelihood of an SME’s ability to repay over the next 12 months. This is premised on their payment behaviour over the past 12 months.</p><p>“If they have been successful in making payments over the last 12 months then the probability of defaulting in payment is low and vice versa,” he tells StarBizWeek.</p><p>Another scale used in credit rating, he adds, is the percentile ranking which shows SMEs ability to pay relative to the entire SME universe. The higher the percentile ranking, the higher the SME’s ability to pay up the loan, he notes.</p><p>Having credible information and reliable data cuts down the bank’s processing time for applications of loans by average between 20% and 30%.</p><p>Having tied-up with US-based Dun &amp; Bradstreet, he says, has enable the Bureau to localise and tap the expertise of its partner in credit ratings as the former has years of experience in the specialisation of solutions for credit bureaus worldwide. Dun &amp; Bradstreet’s methodology has been used by credit bureau’s globally for more than two decades.</p><p>The Bureau at present has about 26,500 SME members fromover 500,000 SMEs in the country, and 38 member financial institutions. These include commercial banks, development financial institutions and Islamic banks.</p><p>SMEs wanting to be members must sign a contract with the Bureau. Based on the principal of reciprocity, they can only then access information if they provide authentic data to the Bureau.</p><p>Lim stresses that the Bureau does not provide any recommendations to extend or deny credit to SMEs, but rather aid them in building a track record and financial standing for facilitating funding.</p><p>He points out that the Bureau has spent millions to ensure that the data retrieved and stored is safe and not open to tampering or abuse. He says it will make significant investment over time in its bid to become a one-stop centre for credit information for financial institutions and SMEs.</p><p>To beef up its credit ratings and to curb fraud, the Bureau will launch on Feb 1 Malaysia’s first Credit Monitoring Services (CMS) for SMEs. Early this month, it introduced a similar service for financial institutions. The CMS system monitors key changes in banking and business information, trade credit information as well as credit ratings of SMEs.</p><p>These changes in data are then sent out as email alerts to SMEs who subscribe to the service.</p><p>By alerting them, Lim says the CMS can prevent fraud and identity theft as well as any discrepancies or changes to their credit information.</p><p>Identity theft occurs, for example, if an SME’s identity is used illegally to apply for credit, and changes to credit information occur when there is new loan applications, enquiries by financial institutions, and other credit guarantors and utilities related updates.</p><p>Apart from receiving email alerts upon changes of their information in the Bureau’s database, SMEs may also purchase the self enquiry report separately if more detailed information is required, he noted. A nominal fee of RM50 per year will be imposed on SMEs that wish to subscribe for the service.</p><p>“An effective CMS system will ensure that SMEs growth will not be hindered or affected by identity theft and fraud. It also ensures their business registry and credit information are kept updated and accurate to ensure their applications for financing will not be jeopardised by inaccurate or out dated credit information,” Lim says, adding that CMS will promote good credit culture among SMEs, which will ultimately lead to more credit facilities in less time.</p>\n",

      "<p>PETALING JAYA: The capital market is set to get its version of the banking sector’s Financial Mediation Bureau (FMB). Once in place, this will be another avenue for retail investors to seek an end to disputes with intermediaries such as stockbrokers, unit trust companies, financial planners and investment advisers.</p><p>In coming up with this so-called alternative dispute resolution framework, the Securities Commission (SC) is consulting industry players as well as public interest groups such as the Minority Shareholder Watchdog Group and the Federation of Malaysian Consumer Associations.</p><p>The regulator is also drawing upon the experiences of Australia, Singapore, Britain and the FMB.</p><p>The need for such an initiative in Malaysia was highlighted in the Capital Market Masterplan, which was issued in February 2001.</p><p>The report said the efforts toward more effective enforcement should include “ensuring appropriate mechanisms for investor redress and dispute resolution that can minimise enforcement costs and delays”. The recent worldwide recession has injected some urgency into the matter.</p><p>“The global crisis demonstrates that one aspect for achieving greater investor protection and confidence is to provide a mechanism whereby investors’ grievances can be settled in an efficient, speedy and amicable manner,” said an SC spokesman.</p><p>“Our study shows that there exists a gap in redress mechanism available to investors in the capital market.”</p><p>The spokesman added that investors would normally try to first resolve their disputes directly with the intermediaries. The drawback here was that the investors might perceive the intermediaries as biased.</p><p>The investors cannot turn to the Malaysian Consumer Claims Tribunal because it excludes disputes relating to securities and futures transactions. Neither can they go to the FMB, which focuses on disputes relating to banking, insurance and payment transactions.</p><p>“The only other avenue that is an independent and transparent redress mechanism is through legal proceedings in the courts or arbitration process, which can be lengthy and costly for both the investor and intermediary,” said the SC spokesman.</p><p>The regulator said details for the alternative dispute resolution framework were being worked out with various industry groups in the capital market. Under the Capital Market and Services Act 2007, regulations may be issued to deal with dispute resolution between persons involved in capital market transactions.</p><p>“Once the review is completed, appropriate regulations and guidelines would be released by the SC,” said the spokesman.</p><p>The FMB describes itself as an independent body set up to help settle disputes between consumers and the financial services providers, who are its members.</p><p>These members include commercial banks, investment banks, Islamic banks, insurance companies, takaful operators, development financial institutions, and payment system operators and payment instrument issuers.</p><p>In its website, the bureau explains that mediation is a process by which the mediator helps both the complainant and the financial service provider to resolve the complaint by first investigating the complaint.</p><p>If the parties involved in the complaint cannot reach an amicable settlement, the mediator will make a decision based on the investigation, industry practices and the relevant applicable law. The FMB’s award or decision is binding on the institutions but not the complainant.</p><p>In Singapore, Britain and Australia, the organisations that mediate complaints relating to capital market transactions come under boards of directors that represent both industry and consumer interests.</p>\n",

      "<p>NATIONAL deposit insurer, Perbadanan Insurans Deposit Malaysia (PIDM), expects to increase awareness of deposit insurance in Malaysia to 40% by 2011.</p><p>The awareness of deposit insurance had increased to 27% last year compared with 13% and 15% in 2006 and 2007 respectively, based on an annual nationwide survey commisioned by PIDM.</p><p>According to its communications and public affairs general manager S. Loganathan, communications and public awareness is one of PIDM’s key functions in ensuring the effectiveness of the deposit insurance system.</p><p>“Awareness of deposit protection is important because it promotes public confidence in the financial system. With greater awareness, the public will be assured that their deposits are protected.</p><p>“A well-informed public is less susceptible to rumours relating to the viability of a bank,” Loganathan explains.</p><p>In 2008, the deposit insurer spent over RM6mil for its public awareness programmes.</p><p>These programmes include public talks, roadshows, seminars, conferences as well as advertising campaigns via various media channels such as television, radio and print.</p><p>What is unique about PIDM’s awareness programmes is that its advertisements and communications channels are available in various languages.</p><p>Its website, www.pidm.gov.my, is accessible in Bahasa Malaysia, English, Chinese and Tamil while the public information brochures, entitled Your Deposits Are Protected, are available in the four languages as well as two others – Kadazandusun and Iban – for the benefit of depositors in Sabah and Sarawak.</p><p>Deposit insurance was introduced in the United States in 1934 during the Great Depression.</p><p>A wave of bank failures in 1930 triggered widespread attempts to convert deposits into cash, according to Loganathan.</p><p>“As more banks were unable to meet withdrawals and closed, depositors became more sensitive to rumours. Confidence in the banking system started to erode and incidences of bank ‘runs’ became more common,” he says. (A run on bank refers to the state of panic which results when a large number of customers fear a bank could be insolvent and rush to withdraw their deposits.)</p><p>The enactment of the Banking Act 1933 by the US government and the setting up of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) restored public confidence and significantly reduced the incidences of bank runs.</p><p>In Malaysia, the 2001 Financial Sector Masterplan recommended the setting up of a deposit insurance system to further strengthen the depositor protection framework.</p><p>PIDM, a statutory body established under the Akta Perbadanan Insurans Deposit Malaysia 2005, was formed in August 2005 and the deposit insurance system was launched on Sept 1, 2005.</p><p>Under the system, PIDM provides explicit coverage of RM60,000 per depositor per member bank.</p><p>“In the unlikely event of a bank failure, depositors will be promptly reimbursed on their insured deposits,” Loganathan says.</p><p>However, with the implementation of the Government Deposit Guarantee (GDG) in October 2008, all ringgit and foreign currency deposits are fully protected until Dec 31, 2010.</p><p>The GDG applies to deposits held in commercial, Islamic, investment and international Islamic banks, as well as in deposit-taking development financial institutions regulated by Bank Negara.</p><p>According to Loganathan, the current plans are to revert to the explicit and limited coverage deposit insurance system after the aforesaid date.</p><p>On whether the limit or scope of coverage will be increased going forward, Loganathan says PIDM will continue to monitor developments in the banking system and will make recommendations to the Government.</p><p>In relation to this, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Bank Negara and the Monetary Authority of Singapore announced on July 22 the setting up of a tripartite working group to map out a coordinated strategy for the scheduled exit of the full deposit guarantee by the end of 2010.</p><p>Besides assessing and collecting premiums from member banks, PIDM’s functions also include managing deposit insurance funds as well as providing incentives to promote sound risk management in Malaysia’s financial system.</p><p>For the financial year ended Dec 31, 2008 (FY08), PIDM recorded revenue of RM98.5mil, comprising RM90mil premiums and RM8.5mil investment income. Its operating expenditure totalled RM34.5mil.</p><p>PIDM’s conventional and Islamic deposit insurance funds stood at RM243mil and RM32.3mil respectively at the end of 2008.</p><p>For FY09, PIDM targets a premium revenue of RM147mil, driven by the full implementation of the differential premium system (DPS) for its member banks.</p><p>According to Loganathan, the DPS differentiates member banks according to their risk profile and classifies them into four premium categories.</p><p>The tiered premium rates range from 0.03% of the total insured deposits for Category One financial institutions to a maximum of 0.24% for those in Category Four.</p><p>“This is part of our efforts to promote better risk management,” he said.</p><p>Until 2007, PIDM have assessed premiums against its member institutions on a flat rate of 0.06% of total insured deposits.</p><p>Moving forward, Loganathan says PIDM will continue to focus on intensifying its risk assessment besides developing its capacity to handle intervention and failure resolutions as well as developing its human capital.</p>\n",

We expect the NPL level in the SME portfolio to remain relatively low and manageable,” she says.</p><p>Alliance Bank sees the most important factor to assess SMEs during the downturn is business sustainability and viability going forward.</p><p>“Losses made by a company may be temporary but if the business exudes great potential to survive and has a good business model, we will continually support the business,” says Lai.</p><p>Peter Y. C. Chow, head of group business and investment banking at EON Bank group, says it will not reject a credit application just because the borrower makes losses in its current financial year, noting that its credit evaluation criteria have not changed significantly despite the slowing economy.</p><p>He says the bank will also evaluate the experience of the borrower’s management, business viability as well as its current and projected cashflow.</p><p>OCBC’s Chew says the bank has developed a robust credit scoring framework for assessing SMEs, noting that the scoring system is used to approve any credit facility.</p><p>Thereafter, the bank will assess the health (business performance) of SME customers through its Early Warning &amp; Monitoring System, which helps it gain the necessary information to advise customers and work with them long before NPLs arise.</p><p>“We do not strike customers off simply because of losses experienced; rather, we look at the positive cashflow of the business, the economic environment as well as the industry,” says Chew.</p><p>EON Bank’s Chow reckons that the current contraction in the economy has given rise to challenges such as slower loans growth, intense competition among financial institutions for the more viable SMEs and expected increase in loan delinquencies.</p><p>Alliance Bank expects the current financial year to be challenging with revenue and margins under further downward pressure. “In such an environment, our SME banking unit will focus on defending its margins through aggressive cross-selling initiatives and introducing innovative products and services,” says Lai.</p><p>OCBC’s Chew says: “Demand for credit has declined significantly across industries. Many business establishments are adopting a wait-and-see attitude in order to be better positioned to make sound judgments for the future.</p><p>RHB Banking Group head of retail banking Renzo Viegas says greater challenges affecting the SMEs’ business opportunities are inevitable.</p><p>“RHB continues to be proactive in managing the needs of SMEs facing difficulties through consultation and discussion while at the same time being predicated on prudent lending decisions.</p><p>Credit Guarantee Corp (CGC) managing director and chief executive officer Datuk Wan Azhar Wan Ahmad says access to financing will continue to remain one of the main issues for SMEs, especially those that are unable to provide adequate credit information for credit assessment, poor cashflow management and track record.</p><p>“SMEs will also be in a more competitive business environment going forward. SMEs that are comparatively less equipped in terms of both human and capital resources will be at a disadvantage,” he says.</p><p>Azhar adds: “We have been working closely with the Government and Bank Negara to implement special initiatives or programmes benefiting the SME sector.</p><p>“CGC has also widened its range of products and services and the scope of guarantee beneficiaries to include Islamic banks and development financial institutions with the aim of enhancing its SME outreach.</p><p>“Additionally, we are putting greater focus on hand-holding and advisory services as well as briefing sessions in collaboration with Small and Medium Industries Development Corporation and other SME-related agencies, to help SMEs better manage their business and finances,” he says.</p>\n",

Part of the institutional building was the establishment of regulatory institutions such as the Securities Commission, the Cooperative Commission and the Labuan Offshore Financial Services Authority.</p><p>Specialised development financial institutions were also set up to provide financial services to sectors that were not serviced by existing financial institutions.</p><p>The 1960s saw the rapid expansion of domestic financial institutions while the 1970s witnessed the emergence of merchant banking, the capital market and non-bank financial institutions.</p><p>In the last two decades, a comprehensive Islamic financial system has also evolved in Malaysia including institutions, markets and supporting legal, regulatory and supervisory framework.</p><p>Since 1988, the central bank also assumed responsibility for the insurance industry and the development of financial institutions in 2002.</p><p>Financial market development has also been central to building a robust financial system. Bank Negara’s efforts in this direction included establishing institutions and the infrastructure to improve the efficiency of money, capital and foreign exchange markets.</p><p>The 1990s saw the establishment of the Securities Commission responsible for the securities industry, financial futures and options markets, unit trust and property trust schemes, as well as takeovers and mergers.</p><p>In addition to the ratings agencies, the Credit Guarantee Corp was established to provide support for small businesses while the national mortgage corporation, Cagamas Bhd, was formed to ensure a steady flow of funds to the housing industry and to develop a secondary mortgage market.</p><p>In terms of financial infrastructure, the central bank set up the centrally coordinated credit information system at national level which allows for better-informed credit decisions by financial institutions.</p><p>Also part of the financial infrastructure is payments, which has evolved from mainly paper-based to one that includes a range of new electronic forms of payment.</p><p>To ensure stability in the financial system, the central bank’s prudential regulatory and supervisory framework during the past 50 years has also undergone significant evolution.</p><p>The prudential framework, which at the start comprised simple rules addressing capital, gearing, liquidity and portfolio restrictions, has evolved into a more differentiated and principle-based regulations reflecting the levels of risks taken by an institution.</p><p>Flexible framework</p><p>As a result, significantly greater flexibility is now accorded to institutions that demonstrate sound governance practices and robust risk management capabilities.</p><p>This flexibility has been accompanied by fundamental changes in supervision which has shifted from a predominantly compliance-based approach, to one that focuses on the assessment of risk-taking activities of an institution and the control functions to manage the risks.</p><p>The supervisory tools have also grown to include forward-looking assessments of the risks to financial stability, supported by more dynamic stress testing and enhanced surveillance systems.</p><p>The Financial Sector Masterplan, released in 2001, is a blueprint for comprehensive financial sector reforms and provides the framework and strategies for the modernisation of the financial system.</p><p>The financial safety net was also strengthened with the introduction of a comprehensive deposit insurance system and organisations to help consumers manage their debts and resolve disputes with financial institutions.</p><p>During the Asian financial crisis, when regional currencies plummeted to historical lows, Malaysia implemented selective capital controls and de-internationalised the ringgit. This was instrumental in restoring stability in the market and acted very much like a circuit breaker.</p><p>Offshore trading of the ringgit, the major source for financing the speculative attacks, was effectively eliminated. Within a year, all the controls imposed were removed.</p><p>An extensive set of measures was also implemented during the Asian financial crisis, including a comprehensive restructuring programme for the financial and corporate sectors.</p><p>While still at the early stage of the crisis, an asset management company was formed to acquire and manage the non-performing loans of banking institutions.</p><p>A special-purpose vehicle to recapitalise banking institutions and a Corporate Debt Restructuring Committee were also established to provide avenues for voluntary debt restructuring of businesses.</p><p>Within six months of the implementation of these measures, the problems in the financial sector were addressed and lending activities resumed.</p><p>Once stability was restored, the central bank embarked on a comprehensive restructuring and reform of the financial sector.</p><p>These included the consolidation of domestic financial institutions, strengthening corporate governance, risk management and the institutional capacity of domestic financial institutions, as well as the deepening of the bond market.</p><p>These efforts have put Malaysia’s financial system in a much stronger position to weather the current global financial crisis.</p>\n",

      "<p>THE global economy is expected to stabilise by the end of next year and Malaysia is likely to return to the previous deposit insurance limit from the current blanket guarantee on all deposits.</p><p>“The government guarantee is until the end of 2010, which means that over this period of time, depositors are fully protected’’ said PIDM CEO Jean Pierre Sabourin.</p><p>“The blanket guarantee is a pre-emptive move. Part of our corporate plan this year and next will be transitioning from this blanket guarantee back to the limited protection by PIDM.’’ Currently, that is limited to RM60,000 per depositor per bank, which is likely to be reviewed, depending on the circumstances.</p><p>That transition will be easier for Malaysia as it has maintained the RM60,000 guarantee by PIDM. Above that is guaranteed by the Government but administered by PIDM.</p><p>Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore have announced a blanket guarantee of two years. However, PIDM reviews the situation on an ongoing basis and will make its recommendation to the Government.</p><p>As part of a deposit insurance tsunami, countries had substantially raised the protection for depositors following the worst banking crisis that the world had not witnessed for a long time.</p><p>The US raised its deposit insurance from US$100,000 to US$250,000 and Europe from 20,000 euros to 50,000 euros, then 100,000 euros.</p><p>Australia, which never had deposit insurance, put in a blanket guarantee and was followed the next day by New Zealand and subsequently by Hong Kong.</p><p>On Oct 16 last year, Malaysia and Singapore announced a blanket guarantee on all deposits. Taiwan did the same thing and Indonesia’s protection for depositors went from US$8,500 to US$250,000.</p><p>“Once put in place, it will be difficult to remove,’’ said Sabourin. PIDM will maintain the RM60,000 and administer the government guarantee above this amount. Essentially, PIDM is responsible for the entire amount of deposits.</p><p>PIDM will soon charge a guaranteed fee to all its member commercial and Islamic banks for deposits above RM60,000 per depositor and for products not insured, for example, foreign currency deposits.</p><p>Apart from member banks, PIDM also charges the guaranteed fee on investment banks, international Islamic banks and deposit taking development financial institutions (DFIs).</p><p>“We will take that fee and pay it to the Government which is giving us the guarantee,’’ said Sabourin.</p><p>The task of building confidence is a serious matter at PIDM. It involves setting up public awareness campaigns, training at branches, meeting bank officers together with officers from Bank Negara, the Financial Mediation Bureau (FMB), credit counselling and management agency (AKPK) and meeting the public on how the entire system works.</p><p>Its brochures, annual reports and website come in several languages. For the call centre, toll free lines are available in four languages and main dialects. “This is what the Government should do ... (explain to people) as slowly as they require and in the language they understand.’’</p><p>“I feel confident (that we can deal with any crisis), with all the infrastructure in place and the vision in this country,’’ said Sabourin.</p><p>Together with deposit insurance, the system is backed by the AKPK, FMB, Islamic banking system, government stimulus package, guarantees and lately, the Corporate Debt Restructuring Committee (CDRC).</p><p>“It seems to me they have put in the whole package,’’ he said. “Everyone is working together. Banks are also working with their clients on any potential financial problems. “They invite customers to talk to them. In some other countries, people don’t even know who to call if they are losing their homes,’’ he said.</p><p>Globally, the response to the crisis has been two-pronged. Governments in Europe, Britain and the United States have been putting in a lot of liquidity and capital. The other approach, adopted by countries like Malaysia, is to put in place mechanisms to promote stability and public confidence.</p><p>For latest Bursa Malaysia indices, charts and other information click here  </p><p>For latest Bursa Malaysia indices, charts and other information click here</p>\n",

      "<p>THANKS to Bank Negara’s intervention, some 35% of the more than 230 small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) that complained of difficulty gaining access to financing have good reason to cheer.</p><p>Corporate communications department director Abu Hassan Alshari Yahaya tells StarBizWeek that of the complaints received from these SMEs between October and January this year, 81% have been resolved.</p><p>For the resolved cases, 44% were in favour of the SMEs and involved restructuring and rescheduling of loans, and also approval of loans that were initially rejected.</p><p>The central bank will continue to monitor communications among banks and SMEs, he says.</p><p>He says Bank Negara receives about 700 complaints and enquiries from SMEs and the public every day on issues ranging from restructuring and rescheduling of credit line, delay in loan approvals, changes in credit terms, bank charges, credit card issues, funds for SMEs and credit report.</p><p>“We encourage banks to look closer into  customers’ complaints. We give the banks a timeline (about two weeks) to respond to Bank Negara enquiries on what they are going to do about the complaints.</p><p>“While we are assisting SMEs, we also encourage SMEs to approach their banks early,” he says.</p><p>He adds that in processing SMEs loan applications, most banks find that SMEs have no track record and provide insufficient information.</p><p>Meanwhile, he suggests the smaller SMEs consider special funds that cater for them, which come with lower interest rates.</p><p>For example, the Fund for SMEs 20 is based on revolving loan charges between 4% and 6% interest rate per year. The fund still has RM280mil available.</p><p>The new Entrepreneurs Fund 2, which also offers 4% to 6% interest rate per year, has RM270mil available for new SMEs without an established record.</p><p>These loans are available at commercial banks.</p><p>United Overseas Bank (M) Bhd head of business banking division James Seow concurs that the most common problem faced by banks is insufficient information provided in the application.</p><p>“To avoid any inconvenience, we advise all applicants to work closely with their respective bank’s relationship managers. Financial health is integral to the success of SMEs’ loan application,” he tells StarBizWeek in an e-mail interview.</p><p>The general loan application requirements include having a business that has been operating for at least three years with an annual turnover of RM20mil and less, he says.</p><p>Seow says SMEs are the bank’s main target segment.</p><p>“We are now more aggressive in assisting our SME customers by customising loan packages to suit their business financial needs. The government guarantee will definitely help the bank mitigate some of the business risk,” he says.</p><p>According to Seow, the base lending rate remains the same for SME and corporate loans. The difference in interest rates is due to the loan amount, customer’s risk profile and the rates recommended by Bank Negara.</p><p>SMI Association of Malaysia president Chua Tiam Wee says the reversal in banks’ decision on financing facilities for SMEs is encouraging news to the industry in the current economic slowdown.</p><p>He says the association, which has been bringing SMEs’ financing issue to Bank Negara, has in the past few months held several dialogues with the central bank on the challenges faced by SMEs.</p><p>Chua urges SMEs to use the Bank Negara-initiated portal www.smeinfo.com.my as an avenue to air their problems and concerns.</p><p>The portal is a one-stop Web-based SME resources centre that contains the profiles and contact details of SME business advisers in the various government agencies, commercial banks and development financial institutions.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Association of Banks in Malaysia executive director Chuah Mei Lin assures the SMEs that bankers are not just fair weather friends, as banks fully appreciate the collaboration and partnership with customers in times when businesses contract.</p><p>“SMEs must themselves be active participants in raising capital and it is important that they demonstrate adaptability to change.</p><p>“Banks are also proactively managing their portfolio of loans to help customers during this downturn,” she says.</p><p>She says applicants must not only build a track record of prudent financial management but also keep debt commitments at a level proportionate to cashflow generative capability.</p>\n",

      "<p>PETALING JAYA: Despite the Government’s assurance that banks have ample liquidity and the ability to lend, companies – including small and medium enterprises (SMEs) – are facing mounting pressure by the day to obtain financing.</p><p>While many successful applications have been overturned, others are having their existing loans reviewed and overdraft facilities reduced. Banks are also limiting the sectors to which they can lend.</p><p>Bank Negara’s latest cut in the overnight policy rate and the statutory reserve requirement to reduce the cost of funds appears to have fallen on the deaf ears of many banks.</p><p>SMI Association of Malaysia Fund Raising Bureau chairman Steven Lim said in a recent dialogue with various business associations, Bank Negara governor Tan Sri Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz had confirmed that banks were in a strong position to lend.</p><p>“Contrary to this, Malaysian banks are not heeding the central bank’s advice and are over-cautious when lending is concerned.</p><p>“Even the process for deserving applicants can be very tedious. The processing and turnaround time for the loans to be approved can take three to four months in some cases and this can defeat the customers’ business objectives,” he said in an e-mail reply to StarBiz.</p><p>To make things worse, Lim added, even deserving applicants in some cases were unsuccessful in their applications and blamed banks for over-reacting to the global economic slowdown and the financial crisis.</p><p>About 99% of business establishments in the country consisted of SMEs, which contributed 32% to the gross domestic product (GDP), provided 56% employment and accounted for 19% of total exports last year.</p><p>Banking and development financial institutions approved RM63.2bil in funding for over 132,000 SME accounts in 2007, exceeding the target of RM51bil to 110,000 accounts projected for last year.</p><p>It is learnt that banks had started reviewing existing loan files to determine whether borrowers (including companies and businessmen) were capable of repayment in the near future, failing which, loans would either be reduced or called back.</p><p>A company involved in the iron and steel industry recently had its overdraft facility slashed to half the original approved sum of RM200mil on the grounds that the price of raw materials had plummeted. There are others facing a similar predicament.</p><p>According to Lim, banks had also imposed “barred sectors” on certain industries, such as development and construction, used-car dealers and transportation where they were the least to be considered for any loan application.</p><p>According to a CEO of a manufacturing company, banks were shoring up their recovery departments in anticipation of “problem” loans expected to emerge next year.</p><p>.</p><p>Standard Chartered Bank (M) Bhd (StanChart) managing director and CEO Julian Wynter, on the other hand, said the bank had not reduced its lending or changed the way it undertook credit assessment – both to individuals and businesses.</p><p>“We do not expect a dramatic shift in lending practices. We should expect tightening of underwriting standards in the market but, for StanChart, our standards are already robust and we continue to apply them.</p><p>“At the same time there may be a focus on collateral to ensure optimisation of capital so that lending can remain in place and/or lower pricing. These factors will allow a bank to ensure that its asset quality remains strong,’’ he added.</p><p>StanChart’s lending to medium enterprises had expanded 40% over the last 12 months from October 2007.</p><p>Wynter said the bank’s trade and working capital disbursement pipeline as at Oct 31 was 99% higher than (the disbursement pipeline) as at Jan 31.</p><p>According to him, the bank aimed to double its lending to SMEs to RM6bil in 2011.

In 2006, a total of RM46.5bil loans were approved to more than 102,000 SME accounts by both banking and development financial institutions (DFIs).</p><p>According to the 2006 SME Annual Report, these financial institutions were expected to approve a total of RM51bil loans to about 110,000 SME accounts last year.</p><div class=\"migration_image\" style=\"width:364px\"> <img alt=\"\" height=\"221\" src=\"https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/58AB3ED7-82F7-4747-B60F-1DFD91EC9FB0\" width=\"350\"/><span class=\"migration_caption\">Jason Tan</span></div><p>In 2006, RM48.1bil of financing was provided by the banking institutions, DFIs and other agencies to 240,000 SMEs.</p><p>A total of RM46.5bil worth of loans were approved to more than 102,000 SME accounts by both the banking institutions and DFIs in 2006. Banking institutions were the main provider of funds to SMEs, with a total approval of RM39.6bil to more than 84,000 SME accounts.</p><p>Reflecting an increasing trend, loans to SMEs from banking institutions had risen from 31.1% of total business loans in 2000 to 44.5% in 2006. Total SME outstanding loans from banking institutions breached the RM100bil level in 2006.</p><p>The success of many smaller companies including SMEs, among others, depends on the efficient management of working capital (WC).</p><p>WC is a measure of both a company's efficiency and its short-term financial health. Positive working capital means that the company is able to pay off its short-term liabilities. Negative working capital, on the other hand, means that a company is currently unable to meet its short-term liabilities with its current assets.</p><p>If a company's current assets do not exceed its current liabilities, then it may run into trouble paying back creditors in the short term. The worst-case scenario is bankruptcy.</p><p>HSBC Bank Malaysia Bhd director for global payments and cash management Jason Tan said with the global inflation and credit market tightening, companies including SMEs were finding it difficult to obtain loans or manage WC efficiently.</p><p>Although Malaysia was relatively quite insulated compared with other countries, this trend was slowly creeping into the country, he added.</p><p>“This has led SMEs to be squeezed on both ends – the difficulty in getting loans to finance their collections on one end, and to make their payments on the other end. They should work closely with their banking partners on how to manage their collections and payments efficiently,” he added.</p><p>According to Tan, some banks now provide earlier financing to SMEs who are waiting for their collections from buyers. This sort of financing allows faster collection for SMEs although the financing would be at a discounted amount to the original sum that buyers owed them.</p><p>Apart from the above trend, banks are also playing a more proactive role in providing advisory services to this sector. This include short messaging service (SMS) and e-mailing to buyers on behalf of SMEs for payments and collections.</p><p>HSBC Bank has recommended five tips for SMEs to shop and ensure efficient WC. Firstly, they should start to take advantage of early payment incentives offered by its business partners.</p><p>Secondly, they should stretch out their payable period and maximise it if possible. Thirdly, they should organise and have systematic billing schedule to ensure faster collection, hence the ability to grow their business faster.</p><p>Fourthly, they need to have better control of their inventory to help improve cash flow and lastly they need to check their pricing and hike it if possible in accordance with the global economic indicators.</p><p>For more details contact: 1800 88 3898</p>\n",

      "<p>PETALING JAYA: Rabobank International, a leading global financier for the food and agro business, is looking at setting up banking operations in Malaysia after expanding its banking footprint in China and Indonesia. </p><p> Although details are sketchy, it is learnt that the Netherlands-based bank is already talking to local development financial institutions initially on the provision of technical assistance and other credit issues. </p><p> An industry observer said this collaboration was a starting point for the bank to gradually initiate merger and acquisition plans going forward as Rabobank's expansion in the region and elsewhere had been mainly through acquisitions. </p><p> Rabobank last year acquired 10% of China's United Rural Cooperative Bank of Hangzhou. In Indonesia, it owns two small- and medium-scale enterprise banks, Bank Haga and Bank Hagakita. </p><p> A source told StarBiz that the bank viewed Malaysia as a favourable destination compared with other Asian countries as it was rich in terms of the food and agro business as well the potential of the aquaculture and seafood industry here. </p><p> The source said the bank was “digesting” its banking operations in China and Indonesia and that when it was finished, it would spread its wings to Malaysia. </p><p> The bank has indicated it was open to acquisitions as a way to grow in Asia, given its focus on food and agro-business financing. </p><p> “Close to 85% of total palm oil output comes from Malaysia and Indonesia and as an agriculture-based bank, Rabobank is keen to get a licence to operate in the country as this will facilitate its operations and allow its plans for Malaysia to materialise. </p><p> “It is just waiting for the right time and possibly a suitable local development banking partner to tie up with before it can commence operations,'' the source said. </p><p> Rabobank has said in earlier reports that it was targeting to be a “house banker” for Malaysian companies, especially plantation-based players seeking expansion overseas as well as those venturing into biodiesel, refineries, seafood and other agriculture-related activities. </p><p> It also wants to be actively involved in the development of the Northern Corridor Economic Region. </p><p> Rabobank has a marketing office in Kuala Lumpur, which was set up in December 2005, and a branch in Labuan, set up in March the same year. </p><p> Rabobank has a AAA credit rating from Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, making it the only privately owned bank in the world to achieve such a status.  </p><p>  </p><p></p><p></p><p>\n",

Abdullah said this would be complemented by a target to approve 37,000 loans under the various Government schemes. </p><p> ”We also target to finance 40 new companies in the information and communications technology (ICT) sector under the ICT Fund and to establish 35 projects under the Biotechnology Commercialisation Grant. </p><p> “To enhance access to financing for SMEs, Bank Negara will introduce <i>syariah-</i>based financing facilities for special funds and new trade financing products,” he added. </p><p> The securitisation of SME loan programme will also be introduced this year, while the SME Bank will further increase its lending. </p><p> The council also endorsed the strategies and marketing initiatives formulated by the SME Marketing Committee to further increase the penetration of domestic SMEs’ products and services in the global market. </p><p> A comprehensive programme to be implemented this year will assist in capacity building, promotion, information management and provision of financial support to facilitate SMEs in marketing their products and services overseas. </p><p> Abdullah said several financial institutions had committed to provide individuals and micro-enterprises with fast, flexible and convenient access to funds to support their businesses. </p><p> The council was briefed on the initiative to promote micro-financing. Several financial institutions will launch new micro-finance products in the first quarter of 2007. </p><p> The council agreed that a common micro-finance logo would be developed to create awareness.

But high interest rates may force SMEs to be more careful in planning their cashflow, as borrowing costs go up,” he added. </p><p> However, CGC believes that non-performing loans would come down if there were better capacity for repayment (as financial institutions make it easier for SMEs to pay their loans). </p><p></p><table align=\"left\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"7\" width=\"144\"> <tr><td> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/829F6067-4AB9-4349-9BCE-873C1DE1FD16\"/> </td></tr> <tr><td><div class=\"migration_caption\">Datuk Wan Azhar Wan Ahmad</div></td></tr></table><p> Wan Azhar said the company would go through “a bit of consolidation” in the current year, as there would be expansion and investment activities.  </p><p> CGC also plans to upgrade its systems and expand staff force. </p><p> “While we expect to generate income, spending will also go up.

      "<b>By DANNY YAP</b><p>EFFECTIVE Feb 1, banking institutions will be required to provide “basic banking services” to Malaysians at minimal costs, Bank Negara governor Tan Sri Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz said. </p><p> She said that guidelines had been issued to banking institutions to govern the imposition of fees and charges. </p><p> “The guidelines specify the minimum threshold of services and monthly transactions that are to be offered without charge,” Zeti told reporters after the launch of the Financial Mediation Bureau (FMB) in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.  </p><p> Details of the services offered under the guidelines were also announced yesterday. </p><p> Zeti said that over and above these financial services, as products and services become more complex, financial institutions needed to provide appropriate pricing that not only reflected the costs but also adequately reflected cost savings that arise from the investments made. </p><p> “In an increasingly competitive environment, efforts need to be continuously aimed at enhancing efficiency and cost-effectiveness to bring benefits not only to consumers and businesses but also to the overall economy,” she stressed. </p><p> Zeti said one of the crucial elements of the safety net for consumers was deposit insurance. </p><p></p><table align=\"left\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"7\" width=\"239\"> <tr><td> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/52521591-A0F3-49FE-A554-D8D248CC51CD\"/> </td></tr> <tr><td><div class=\"migration_caption\">Tan Sri Zeti Akhtar Aziz (left) and Tan Sri Haidar Mohamed Noor at the launch of FMB on Thursday.</div></td></tr></table><p> She said work in this area was at an advanced stage and the scheme would be operational soon. </p><p> “The deposit insurance system is expected to further strengthen incentives for financial institutions to adopt sound financial and business practices,” Zeti said, adding that it would also enhance public confidence in the financial system by providing explicit protection on deposits. </p><p> She said Bank Negara would continue to focus on the development of necessary infrastructure to safeguard consumer interest and ensure that consumers were given greater access to information on financial products and services for them to make well-informed choices. </p><p> On the setting up of the FMB, she said that with the blurring of the traditional boundaries between financial products and services provided by banks, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries, an integrated bureau was necessary to resolve a broad range of consumer issues raised in relation to these financial institutions under the supervision of the central bank. </p><p> “There are also clear synergies to be achieved from leveraging on the resources available to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the dispute resolution process, as consumers will be provided with a convenient and efficient one-stop formal redress as an alternative to litigation, which is time consuming and resource draining,” the Governor said. </p><p> Zeti said the creation of an integrated agency was in line with international trends towards such resolution centres, and the framework and model for the FMB had been benchmarked against best practices worldwide, notably in countries such as Britain, Canada and Australia. </p><p> The scope of FMB has been expanded to cover, for the first time, Islamic banks, <i>takaful </i>operators, development financial institutions, as well as select payment systems operators and non-bank issuers of credit and charge cards. </p><p> “Apart from the expanded coverage, FMB plans to improve its nationwide accessibility by progressively establishing five regional offices,” she said. </p><p> FMB chairman Tan Sri Haidar Mohamed Noor pointed out that the bureau would be governed by a board of directors comprising nine members, of whom five are independent directors, and the balance from the banking and insurance industries. </p><p> “The FMB, being an alternative dispute resolution centre, provides consumers with an option to the courts with their complaints, disputes or claims,” he said. </p><p> For banking and other financial institutions, he said FMB would handle claims not exceeding RM100,000 for both consumer and corporate banking related businesses. </p><p> For fraud cases involving credit cards, charge cards and cheques, FMB would handle cases not over RM25,000. </p><p> For Islamic insurance (<i>takaful</i>) cases, the value should not be more than RM200,000 (motor and fire insurance) and for third-party damage, not more than RM5,000. </p><p> “The decision of the FMB is binding on the financial service provider but not the consumer,” Haidar said, adding that dissatisfied complainant may proceed with legal proceedings. </p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.bnm.gov.my/index.php?ch=8&amp;pg=14&amp;ac=964\" target=\"on_top\">Banking Institutions to Offer Basic Savings Account and Basic Current Account -

      "<b></b><p><b>This is the second in a three-part question-and-answer series provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers for <i>The Star</i> readers on various aspects of Budget 2005. The final part will appear in <i>StarBiz</i> tomorrow.</b> </p><p><b><i>Q: The Finance Minister in presenting his 2005 Budget speech spoke on establishing a fund for tax refund. Can you explain what is the effect?  </i></b></p><p> A: When the Government introduced assessment on the current-year basis as well as the self assessment system (SAS), there are companies which have made excess payments on their tax. These companies are entitled to claim refund from the Government. </p><p> Up to now, there has been no change in the procedure of paying refund as tax collected under the Income Tax Act goes into the consolidated fund and cannot be used to make refund.  </p><p> The Inland Revenue Board (IRB) has to obtain the necessary fund from the Treasury. If the Treasury does not provide the fund, the IRB would not be in a position to make the refund.  </p><p> With the establishment of a fund for tax refund, tax collected can be allocated into the fund as determined by the Finance Minister directly and the IRB would be allowed to utilise the monies from the fund to make refund. </p><p> This will certainly improve the Government's delivery system as refunds will be made in a shorter period. </p><p> <u> <b><i></i></b></u>Q: The Finance Minister has announced that there will be changes in claiming the Industrial Building Allowance for purchase of a used industrial building. My company intends to buy a used building to expand its activities. Can you advise me how the proposed change will impact my claim on the industrial building? </p><p> A: The proposed change is to overcome the difficulty faced by the taxpayer, i.e. the acquirer of the used industrial building, in computing the annual allowance, i.e. Industrial Building Allowance (IBA).  </p><p> Based on the current law, the acquirer of a used building can claim IBA based on the tax residual value of the construction cost (i.e. construction cost less allowances claimed to date). The acquirer would have to obtain the information on the construction cost from the vendor. The acquirer may have difficulty in obtaining the information.  </p><p> The proposed change in law is to simplify the claim for IBA as the basis of the computation of IBA will be calculated on the current purchase price notwithstanding that the disposer will be subject to the balancing allowance or balancing charge. In your case, say if the purchase price of the building is RM1mil, the company will be entitled to claim initial allowance of 10% and annual allowance of 3% in the year of acquisition.  </p><p> <b><i>Q: The recent budget proposed that interest-in-suspense be deemed as specific provision for bad debts and allowed a full deduction in the computation of income tax. Does this apply to stockbroking companies? </i></b></p><p> A: Section 34 of the Income Tax Act 1967 (ITA) governs the tax treatment of provision for doubtful debts. The new Section 34 subsection 3B of the Income Tax Act 1967 defines a “bank” as a bank or finance company or a banking and finance company licensed or deemed to be licensed under the Banking and Financial Institutions Act 1989 or Islamic Banking Act 1983, or an institution prescribed under the Development Financial Institutions Act 2002. Stockbroking companies appear not to be covered by the above provision. </p><p> <i> <b>Q: The Government has increased the duty for cigarettes again this year.  As a smoker, can I know how much will the price of cigarettes be increased? </b></i></p><p> A: The 2005 Budget has announced a change in the duty structure for cigarettes. The changes in the rate of import duty and excise duty are as follows: </p><p> <b>Old import duty:</b> RM200/kg. <b>New import duty:</b> RM0.20/stick. </p><p> <b>Old excise duty:</b> RM58/kg. <b>New excise duty:</b> RM81/1,000 sticks.  </p><p> The Minister of Finance in his budget speech mentioned an increase in excise duty rates to promote a healthy lifestyle. The increase in excise duty to be around 40%, for imported as well as locally manufactured cigarettes. The increase in the excise duty would also increase the amount of sales tax paid.  </p><p> The impact of the increase on the consumer would ultimately depend on how much of the increase will be passed down by the tobacco manufacturers and importers. The higher costs will increase the incidence of cigarette smuggling and would have to be addressed by the authorities.  </p><p> <b><i>Q: The abolishment of the import duty on semi-finished components for the wood-based industry would benefit the construction industry. Would this benefit be passed on to the property buyers? </i></b></p><p> A: Although construction costs are expected to be reduced in the case where imported components are used, the benefit may be minimal. It would be up to the developers to determine how much of the reduction, if any to be passed to the property buyers.  </p><p> <b><i>Q:</i></b><u> <b></b></u>It was anticipated that Budget 2005 will be a “caring” budget.  How will Budget 2005 benefit the man in the street? </p><p> A: The proposals that will benefit individual taxpayers at large include the following, which will come into effect beginning in Year of Assessment 2005: </p><p> ·The relief for the purchase of books to increase from RM500 to RM700 to promote the reading habit; </p><p> ·The limit on relief for EPF contributions and/for insurance premium to be increased from RM5,000 to RM6,000; and </p><p> ·The rebate for the purchase of a personal computer to increase from RM400 to RM500 to promote the penetration of ICT into the Malaysian society.  </p><p><b>Part One:</b><a href=\"http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2004/9/12/business/8881316&amp;sec=business\">GST to replace sales and services tax</a> </p><p></p><p></p><p>\n",

      "<b></b><p><b>Amid the interest in GLC revamps, it is easy to forget those that are not listed. Undercapitalised and burdened by bad loans, Bank Industri &amp; Teknologi Malaysia needs rejuvenation. The process has already begun, says Othman Mohd Rijal.</b> </p><p>AMID the expectation that a successful revamp of government-linked companies(GLCs) will boost the stock market,it is easy to forget that not all ofthese companies are listed. For thatmatter, some of them will never getto Bursa Malaysia simply becausemaking profits is not their raisond'être. </p><p>However, even for these companies, there is no escaping the mounting pressure to perform better. Bank Industri &amp; Teknologi Malaysia Bhd knows all about this. It celebrated its 25th anniversary last month, but this year is meaningful not just because of the silverjubilee. </p><p>Undercapitalised and burdened by the high-risk lending it is called upon to provide, Bank Industri is reshaping itself. The restructuring is expected to be completed by the year-end. </p><p>The idea is to become stronger in dealing with changes in the financial services business and in the strategic sectors that the bank focuses on. </p><p>Over the years, the bank's basic role has been the same – to give medium to long-term financing to strategic capital-intensive industries. What have changed significantly are the nature of these industries and the ability of the domestic capital market to finance their businesses. </p><p>Bank Industri chairman Tan Sri Othman Mohd Rijal says the bank must reposition itself to continue to be effective in its role as a development financial institution (DFI) thatsupports these strategic sectors. He points out that the bank has to keep up with rapid advances in high-technology industries so that it can continue to offer financialproducts that meet the demand of these industries. </p><p>In addition, DFIs are perhaps no longer the No.1 option when a high-risk business needs financing. Venture capital and debt securities have become reliable alternatives. </p><p>For Bank Industri, restructuring is a necessary response. Says chairman Tan Sri Othman Mohd Rijal, “We have to repair and clean our balance sheet, and address capitaladequacy issues. Of course, we next have to improve the bank’s organisational structure, processes and operations.” </p><p>The basis of the exercise is an ongoing review done jointly with professional service firm KPMG and Rating Agency Malaysia Bhd (RAM). A development that was instru-mental in pushing the bank towards some serious self-examination was the enactment of the Development Financial Institutions Act, which took effect in February 2002. </p><p>Following this, the bank and two main subsidiaries, Export-Import Bank of Malaysia Bhd (Exim Bank) and Malaysia Export CreditInsurance Bhd (Mecib), came under Bank Negara's supervision. Along with that came the inevitable comparison with other players in the banking sector. </p><p>At the same time, the government's push to reform GLCs, including the introduction of KPIs (key performance indicators), addsimpetus to Bank Industri's restructuring efforts. </p><p>“We welcome this initiative because it brings the management and direction of the business in line with what is stipulated in the act, which essentially emphasises goodmanagement, prudential risk management, and, of course, capital adequacy,” Othman explains. </p><p><b>The DFI difference</b> </p><p>When stacked up against, say, the country's commercial banks, Bank Industri looks very much like a poor cousin. The latter's risk-weighted capital ratio (RWCR) is -29% (a neg-ative ratio means that the capital base is insufficient to cover the assets, including loans) and its net non-performing loans (NPL) ratio as at June was 13.5%. </p><p>According to Bank Negara's July statistics, the commercial banks's RWCR and net NPL ratio stood at 14.2% and 5.8%. The overall banking system had a RWCR of 13.9% and anet NPL ratio of 6.2%. </p><p>However, because Bank Industri is a DFI, there is room to argue that it and commercial banks do not even belong to the same family. “In a way, we are a slightly different creature,” says Othman. </p><p>In a few ways, actually. To begin with, the bank was set up in 1979 to fill a gap in the financial system. Back then, commercial banks were reluctant – and understandably, still are – to take on the high risk thatcomes with lending to certain businesses in the maritime and manufacturing industries. </p><p>But these industries were deemed important to the nation's development goals, and thus DFIs like Bank Industri were required tofinance such businesses. Naturally, that has led to a loan portfolio that has a disproportionate amount of assets of lesser quality. </p><p>Says Othman, “If we were to apply prudence in the same way it is applied among commercial banks, we wouldn't be lending any-thing.” </p><p>Another key difference is that Bank Industri was left out in the restructuring of the banking sector in the wake of the Asian financial crisis. For example, it did notreceive capital injection from Danamodal Nasional Bhd. But it is clear that there is a need to address the bank's weak RWCR. </p><p>Indeed, the bank has sought fresh capital from the government – Minister of Finance (Inc) owns Bank Industri – and at one time, had apparently fancied its chances of getting a positive response. In a rating review published last March, RAM says it had been “given to understand” that the government had agreed to restore the RWCR toat least 8%. According to the rating agency, that would need a capital injection of about RM800mil. </p><p>“The government’s plan to recapitalise the bank is viewed positively by RAM, although we believe that it may take some time before the actual capital injection takes place,”says the report. </p><p>It will be a long wait. Bank Industri is now resigned to making do without recapitalisation by the government. Othman says the capital injection is not likely to happen because the government is now intent on balancing the budget. “I think we have to figure out ways how to repair the bank's capital structure ourselves.” </p><p><b>Floating to the top</b> </p><p>In that respect, it helps that Bank Industri has some useful investments on its books. Last December, for example, it unlocked substantial value when <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=MAYBULK\" target=\"_blank\">MALAYSIAN BULK CARRIERS BHD</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=MAYBULK\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a> (a joint venture with the Kuokgroup) was floated on Bursa Malaysia's main board. </p><p>Through subsidiary Global Maritime Ventures Bhd (GMV), Bank Industri still holds over 20% in the shipping company. “It's alreadylisted and we will harvest the proceeds from there,” says Othman. </p><p>In addition, the bank is banking on gaining from the possible flotation of another shipping business. According to GMV's 2003 annual report, it operated 12 vessels injoint venture with Wawasan Shipping Sdn Bhd, a unit of the IMC group, which is controlled by shipping magnate Tan Sri Frank Tsao. </p><p>The listing proposal is still in the planning stages, but Bank Industri hopes to reap almost RM1bil in cash flow when it eventually disposes of its shares in the two shipping companies. </p><p>“That should bring us to a positive RWCR of 14% to 18%, depending on how we package the deals. That's way above the minimum BankNegara requirement of 8%,” Othman says. “We consider ourselves very lucky because we have made very good investments that are maturing at the right time.” But he concedesthat the bank cannot depend on Lady Luck to bail it out the next time. </p><p>He says because of the kind of lending it does and the portfolio it carries, it may well be back to square one in a matter of a few years. He adds that the bank shouldbe compensated by other measures if a capital injection is not forthcoming. </p><p>The RWCR formula is a source of contention. The bank's group managing director, Datuk Md Noor Yusoff says the formula requires thebank's investment in subsidiaries to be taken out of the bank's capital base. </p><p>He argues, “We have to create so many subsidiaries. Given our small capital, we have to borrow from the market to increase it. The ratio is negative, but we still continue our operations like normal. And theinvestments in the subsidiaries are still good investments.” </p><p>Othman takes a somewhat different approach. He views it as a positive that Bank Industri is included in the authorities' moves to strengthen the country's banking systemand culture. At the same time, he feels that Bank Industri's responsibility for supporting high-risk ventures has to be taken into account. </p><p>“The standards as applied by Bank Negara relates to the business of lending and finance. You can't use a different measurement. A measurement is a measurement. That's it. You've got to accept that. </p><p>“But when the subject matter doesn't really fit (into the framework of standards), you have to look into what can be done to remedythat at policy and structural levels.”When asked if the bank has figured out the remedial measures, Othman says this is being done as part of the strategic review. </p><p>“Whether the government will accept it (the bank's proposal) or whether it has other approaches, I wouldn't know.” </p><p><b>Related story:</b><a href=\"http://biz.thestar.com.my/bizweek/story.asp?file=/2004/9/11/bizweek/8866780&amp;sec=bizweek\" target=\"on_top\">A major role in the country's development</a> </p><p></p><p></p><p>\n",

      "<b></b><p>MALAYSIA will now focus on the development of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) after the successful implementation of Islamic banking and the development of the Islamic capital market in the last 20 years, Second Finance Minister Tan Sri Nor Mohamed Yakcop said. </p><p> NBFIs should be an important pillar in the third wave of development of the Islamic financial system, the first wave being Islamic banking and the second, the Islamic capital market,'' he said at an NBFI seminar on Islamic Alternatives in Kuala Lumpur yesterday. </p><p> Nor Mohamed said certain parts of NBFIs were already well established, such as Tabong Haji, while other components such as equities and Islamic private debt securities, takaful and the collection of personal zakat, had experienced encouraging growth in recent times. </p><p> Nonetheless, many other components of NBFIs have yet to be fully developed, particularly institutions such as waqf, inheritance management, micro credit and Qard Hassan, and corporate zakat.  </p><p> These are important and potentially powerful channels for change and we intend to give these aspects greater focus and attention because these institutions are not only complementary to Islamic banking but, indeed, form an integral part of the total Islamic financial system,'' he said. </p><p> Nor Mohamed said in developing the NBFIs, everyone had a role to play to ensure their success. </p><p> He said in addition to its regulatory role, the government and its agencies were committed to play an important part in kick-starting certain underdeveloped parts of the NBFI sector. </p><p> For example, there is considerable scope for work, through a more socio-economic and distributive focus, to further develop inheritance management, review the system of corporate zakat and revive the institutions waqf. Amanah Raya Bhd is expected to play an important role in these areas, he added. </p><p> As for the private sector, Nor Mohamed said participation would likely be in the promotion of waqf as well as in areas concerning intellectual and human capital, in funding original research and industry think tanks that constitute important public goods that would result in commercially rewarding knowledge and helping to shape responsible public policy. </p><p> At a press conference later, Bank Negara assistant governor Datuk Mohd Razif Abdul Kadir said Malaysia had attracted keen interest from foreign financial institutions to the three proposed Islamic banking licences, judging from the number of applications received before the closing date at the end of the month. </p><p> A lot of interest has been generated. We have to wait for the closing date on March 31 before deciding on the successful candidates, he said. </p><p> We will process those applications as soon as possible. Definitely (the three successful candidates will be announced) this year, he said. </p><p> Malaysia has three full-fledged Islamic banking institutions  Bank Islam (M) Bhd, Bank Muamalat (M) Bhd and Bank Rakyat (M) Bhd  and 13 conventional banks and four development financial institutions offering Islamic banking windows. </p><p></p><p></p><p>\n",

      "<div align=\"RIGHT\"></div><b>BY HASNI MOHD NASIR</b><p>BANK Pembangunan &amp; Infrastruktur (M) Bhd (BPIMB) is gearing up to be a full-fledged infrastructure projects lender with the mandate given by the government for the bank to be more involved in nation-building development. </p><p> Four years since assuming the current name (the bank was previously known as Bank Pembangunan Malaysia Bhd), it has extended loans worth RM8.7bil to various infrastructure projects, mostly big name priority projects identified by the government. </p><p> Last year, BPIMB came under the purview of Bank Negara when it was listed under the Development Financial Institutions Act 2002 (DFIA). The DFIA was to ensure that the roles, objectives and activities of the DFIs are consistent with the government's objectives and that their mandated roles are efficiently and effectively implemented. </p><p> Newly appointed managing director Datuk Abdul Rahim Zin said the bank would continue with its traditional role of assisting small and medium enterprises and at the same time focusing its resources on infrastructure financing. </p><p> “We aim to be a leading financier in both SME and infrastructure development,” he told <i>StarBiz</i> in an interview.  </p><p></p><table align=\"left\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"7\" width=\"174\"> <tr><td> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/0E1406B2-DA43-4E4A-9D7E-4E89D55EE1C3\"/> </td></tr> <tr><td><div class=\"migration_caption\">Datuk Abdul Rahim Zin....BPIMB to continue assisting SMEs.</div></td></tr></table><p> He said, however, the bank would not be competing with other commercial banks for business, but rather, assist these projects should they be in a difficult position to raise funds. </p><p> “It is like a lender of last resort; we would come in when needed. Our rates are as competitive as those offered by other financial institutions,” he said. </p><p> In the past four years since venturing into this new area, the bank has seen its profitability grow by leaps and bounds, from RM97mil recorded in the financial year ended Dec 31, 1999, to RM279mil in financial year 2002. </p><p> Assets have soared from about RM5bil in 1999 to RM12bil in 2002, and then to more than RM13bil this year. </p><p> “We expect to see comparable results for this current financial year,” said Rahim, adding that the bank would strive to generate stable earnings from its activities, and not solely rely on the government for assistance. </p><p> On the development bank side, Rahim said the bank would continue helping bumiputra entrepreneurs raise their wealth profile. </p><p> As at Dec 31, 2002, the bank had extended loans worth RM1.75bil, with the majority of it going to the manufacturing sector, he said. </p><p> Since the bank's inception 30 years ago, it has helped groomed thousands of bumiputra businessmen in various sectors. </p><p> Some of the more successful ventures included second board auto components manufacturer Ingress Corp Bhd, Tracoma Bhd, and food-based industry such as Ramly Burger and Zara Foodstuff Industry Bhd. </p><p> Rahim, who took over the position from Tan Sri Dr Aris Othman, said the bank would implement a number of strategies in line with the focus to be a leading infrastructure lender. </p><p> He said the bank would enhance its risk management system for a more thorough credit rating on the exposure undertaken. </p><p> “We are getting technical assistance from JICA (Japan International Co-operation Agency) and also from our in-house programme in collaboration with Standard &amp; Poor's and other external consultants,” he said. </p><p> He said such risk management was needed considering the type of projects the bank was lending to. </p><p> As the bank's clients are mostly made up of the Muslim community, Rahim said, it was only natural that the bank progress further into Islamic banking. </p><p> “Our portfolio of Islamic lending is still quite small, in the region of 20% for development banking and only one or two in infrastructure financing,” he said. </p><p> He added that BPIMB would eventually move into corporate finance where it would undertake advisory role for the projects. </p><p> “Our involvement in corporate finance is quite small but there is ample room for growth,” he said. </p><p> On the development banking side, Rahim said a number of programmes had already been implemented, such as in the areas of training and advisory. </p><p> Being responsible for helping the bumiputra small businesses, the bank provides various technical training for start-ups and other businesses in various stages of growth. </p><p> “We also provide advisory services, like in what sort of machines or equipment to use in their business,” he said. </p><p> The bank has more than 600 lots of factory complexes in all 13 states which it is renting at very competitive rates. </p><p><b>Related Story:</b><a href=\"http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2003/12/15/business/6910163&amp;sec=business\">Rahim isn’t from same ‘old boy’ alumni</a> </p><p></p><p></p><p>\n",

Significantly, one-third of the issues have been taken up by multinationals. Moreover, almost 70% of the counters on the KLSE are Syariah-compliant. </p><p> Zeti said that in addition to the Islamic banking system, supporting financial infrastructure also needed to be put in place if the vast pool of Islamic funds currently invested in the traditional, conventional instruments was to be tapped. </p><p> She said: The development of non-bank financial intermediaries, such as development financial institutions, savings institutions and housing credit institutions, needs to be developed to meet customers' demands, she said, adding that other core components were the Islamic money market, the Islamic capital market and the takaful market. </p><p> Today, the Islamic money market has become an integral part of the Islamic financial system, with transactions of more than RM2bil a day and a broad spectrum of instruments, which include government investment issues, Bank Negara negotiable notes, Islamic accepted bills and Islamic private debt securities. New players, such as money brokers, have facilitated the development of this market.  </p><p> But, Zeti noted, the challenges facing the Islamic financial industry could be expected to be much more complex and demanding. This is because the regulatory framework in the Islamic financial industry needs to address the peculiar characteristics and attributes associated with Islamic banking operations and Islamic financial instruments. </p><p> She said the advent of Basel II that advocated a higher risk-focused regulatory approach would require the Islamic financial institutions to identify and unbundle the risks inherent in Islamic financial instruments.  </p><p> Players in the Islamic financial industry must, therefore, have in place robust risk management systems and practices. </p><p>  In this regard, she said, the establishment of the Islamic Financial Services Board, which had the mandate of developing prudent standards in accordance with unique features of Islamic financial institutions, was timely. </p><p></p><p></p><p>\n",

It may take up to three months to see confidence returning, especially in the tourism industry.” </p><p> To encourage more domestic spending, Dr Mahathir announced a half-month bonus for civil servants and asked profitable government-owned companies to do the same. He also reduced employees’ contribution to EPF from 11% to 9% for a year from June 1. </p><p> Banks will also play a proactive role in helping to spur consumption, especially by lowering their lending rates, restructuring loans of SARS-affected employees and encouraging investments by small and medium enterprises (SMEs). </p><p> To develop the SMEs as a major catalyst for growth, the Government is setting up a RM500mil Micro Credit Scheme. Many other funds are being set up for retraining of new graduates, investment in new technology and promotion of Malaysian brands.  </p><p> “We have lots of funds but people complain we don’t have access. Banks have said they have filled the lending quota for SMEs but there is still a lot of demand. Therefore, a lot of people resort to moneylenders and get into trouble,” Dr Mahathir said.  </p><p> Incentives for low and medium-cost housing are one of the measures to reduce the gap between “those that have and those that have less.”  </p><p> Under the “Home Ownership for the People” (HOPE) project, the Government will be granting subsidies, interest-free loans, cash payment and tax relief especially for first-time and new housebuyers. </p><p> Syarikat Perumahan Negara Bhd will build an additional 150,000 low and medium-cost homes with priority given to single mothers to purchase them. </p><p> To provide greater flexibility on foreign equity participation, the Foreign Investment Committee (FIC) guidelines will be further liberalised; so will equity conditions for companies, especially foreign ones, seeking listing on the KLSE. </p><p> Besides looking into the cost of doing business, the Government has come up with incentives aimed at improving competitiveness. They involve pioneer status, investment tax allowance and tax incentives for companies doing international trading as well as for hypermarkets and direct-selling companies exporting locally-produced goods. </p><p> Measures to enhance human resource development include greater flexibility in hiring foreign workers with automatic approvals for highly-skilled workers where no local expertise is available. </p><p> On how the Government will fund its portion, Dr Mahathir said it can bear up to RM1.7bil and banks are expected to raise funds via issue of bonds which, he hopes, will be subscribed by cash-rich funds and organisations. </p><p> On the effectiveness of the package, he hopes everyone will support it and that the unions will not protest against the measures.  </p><p><b>Full speech (in Bahasa Malaysia)</b></p><p><a href=\"http://www.smpke.jpm.my/WebNotesApp/PMMain.nsf/hv_PMKiniSemasa/561814C1FC9B5A2148256D2D002E6B45\">From the website of the PM's Office</a></p><p><a href=\"http://thestar.com.my/news/archives/story.asp?ppath=\\2003\\5\\20&amp;file=/2003/5/20/business/wsstimulus&amp;sec=business\" target=\"on_top\">Why the government is taking this initiative and outlook for the Malaysian economy</a><img alt=\"video\" border=\"0\" height=\"9\" src=\"/images/video.gif\" width=\"13\"/> <a href=\"http://202.186.86.35/mmedia/video/sars_030521.rm\" target=\"on_top\">Real player</a> l  <a href=\"http://202.186.86.35/mmedia/video/sars_030521.asf\" target=\"on_top\">Media player</a><img alt=\"video\" border=\"0\" height=\"9\" src=\"/images/video.gif\" width=\"13\"/> <a href=\"http://202.186.86.35/mmedia/video/borrowing_030521.rm\" target=\"on_top\">Real player</a> l  <a href=\"http://202.186.86.35/mmedia/video/borrowing_030521.asf\" target=\"on_top\">Media player</a><img alt=\"video\" border=\"0\" height=\"9\" src=\"/images/video.gif\" width=\"13\"/> <a href=\"http://202.186.86.35/mmedia/video/recouping_030521.rm\" target=\"on_top\">Real player</a> l  <a href=\"http://202.186.86.35/mmedia/video/recouping_030521.asf\" target=\"on_top\">Media player</a><img alt=\"video\" border=\"0\" height=\"9\" src=\"/images/video.gif\" width=\"13\"/> <a href=\"http://202.186.86.35/mmedia/video/funding_030521.rm\" target=\"on_top\">Real player</a> l  <a href=\"http://202.186.86.35/mmedia/video/funding_030521.asf\" target=\"on_top\">Media player</a><img alt=\"video\" border=\"0\" height=\"9\" src=\"/images/video.gif\" width=\"13\"/> <a href=\"http://202.186.86.35/mmedia/video/stimulus_030521.rm\" target=\"on_top\">Real player</a> l  <a href=\"http://202.186.86.35/mmedia/video/stimulus_030521.asf\" target=\"on_top\">Media player</a></p><p><a href=\"http://biz.thestar.com.my/\">More reports in Star Business</a>  </p><p><b>Related Stories:</b><a href=\"http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2003/5/22/nation/aetour&amp;sec=nation\">Boost for tourism sector</a> <a href=\"http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2003/5/22/nation/dihousing&amp;sec=nation\">Incentives for housebuyers</a> <a href=\"http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2003/5/22/nation/fbhyper21&amp;sec=nation\">Incentives will put local products on international market</a> <a href=\"http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2003/5/22/nation/llpakej&amp;sec=nation\">Stimulus to be felt in three months, says Abdullah</a> <a href=\"http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2003/5/22/nation/lrpackage21&amp;sec=nation\">House Buyers Association: Package will encourage ownership</a><a href=\"http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2003/5/22/nation/mucont&amp;sec=nation\">Cuepacs welcomes bonus and 2% EPF reduction</a><a href=\"http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2003/5/22/nation/ihcab&amp;sec=nation\">Perk means little, say cabbies</a><a href=\"http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2003/5/22/nation/rifongcash&amp;sec=nation\">RM600mil more for training</a> </p><p></p><p></p><p>\n",

      "<div align=\"RIGHT\"></div><b>BY HANIM ADNAN</b><p>THE Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) has proposed that the banking sector benchmark themselves against their regional and international counterparts to ensure that their cost of borrowings is competitive. </p><p> This, in turn, would ensure that Malaysian companies were cost competitive when they compete globally, the FMM said in its memorandum to the Finance Ministry on the Budget Dialogue 2004 in Putrajaya yesterday. </p><p> FMM said the margins enjoyed by banks continued to be high given the difference between deposit rates and the base lending rate. </p><p> FMM also proposed alternative forms of collateral for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which could include one or a combination of the following: </p><p> ·Confirmed sales proceeds, </p><p> ·Factoring  allowing SMEs to factor invoices at identified financial windows, </p><p> ·Guarantees from purchasers, </p><p> ·Second charge on property or assets, </p><p> ·Feasibility studies by pre-agreed consultants or special unit, and </p><p> ·Guarantees from directors or holding companies. </p><p> It suggested that as an incentive to financial institutions providing loans with alternative collateral, interest income from such loans be exempt from tax. </p><p> It also proposed that the various SME funds allocate RM500mil to financial institutions (FIs) at a cost of 1.5% which can be extended as credit to SMEs at 3%, with the FIs earning a margin of 1.5%. </p><p> FMM has proposed that the government, development financial institutions and FIs provide fixed, long-term interest rate loans for 20-30 year periods for the purchase of assets, factories and expansion of projects. </p><p> In addition, variable interest rates that increase over the loan repayment period consistent with the growth profile of the company would also ease the financial burden of SMEs. The average rate of interest over the life of the loan should not exceed 4%. </p><p> To bridge the funding requirements of SMEs, they should either be provided with seed capital or debt support on terms less demanding than financial institutions, particularly during the initial years. </p><p> There was also a need to standardise loan documents and business plans, FMM said. </p><p> Designing a template for loan documents and business plans would assist in lowering the cost of borrowing for SMEs and facilitate the refinancing of loans when financial market conditions, in particular interest rates, change. </p><p> Such templates could be designed jointly by Small and Medium Industries Development Corp in consultation with Bank Negara, Association of Banks and FMM.  </p><p></p><p></p><p>\n",

      "<div align=\"RIGHT\"></div><b>BY JAGDEV SINGH SIDHU</b><p> </p><p> THE Association of Banks Malaysia (ABM) sees the new monetary and administrative measures announced by Bank Negara as further proactive steps towards maintaining economic growth, supporting business activity and implementing the Financial Services Masterplan. </p><p> As it noted, the focus is on strengthening the domestic economy through better coordinated delivery and allocation of more funds to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), relaxing the requirements for foreign companies to raise funds locally, and improving the effectiveness of development financial institutions (DFIs).  </p><p> ABM chairman Dr Rozali Mohamed Ali said in a statement yesterday that the central bank had rightly emphasised the need to enhance the level of professionalism in the financial services sector through the establishment of the International Centre for Leadership and Excellence in Finance. </p><p> At the same time, the consumer education programme will be developed to increase awareness of consumers rights and the service levels that should be expected from financial institutions, he noted. </p><p> Economists, meanwhile, see the lowered economic growth forecast of 4.5% for this year as a realistic figure, though this is dependent on what the private sector does. </p><p> And they have not ruled out a cut in interest rates, saying that comments from Bank Negara on Wednesday indicated it was reserving that flexibility should economic conditions worsen. </p><p> There were a lot of caveats in the 4.5% growth estimate, said CIMB economist Lee Heng Guie. But the message is that the government is consolidating and the private sector has to act. </p><p> Economists say it is crucial that the private sector loosens its purse strings as the government would be consolidating its position by spending a little less than previously. </p><p> Estimates are that the private sectors consumption would grow  by 6.9% and private investment by 8.1%.  Greater reliance on the private sector to start spending money comes on the heels of a 3.6% increase in public sector expenditure this year after growing by 8.6% last year. </p><p> Comparing these two sets of official numbers, the downward revision (of the growth forecast) reflects mainly the concern of Iraq war uncertainty and weaker-than-expected global economic conditions, said DBS Bank senior economist Wong Chee Seng. </p><p> Domestically, the numbers suggest that demand conditions remain relatively resilient with real aggregate demand growing by 5.9% versus 4.3% last year. </p><p> Some economists say such private sector growth, although possible, could be difficult in light of global uncertainties.  Private investment had shown positive growth in recent quarters and manufacturing applications had grown by 35% last year. </p><p> An economist with a local brokerage said companies might be hesitant to invest as the capacity utilisation rate had been coming down and there was still a lot of excess capacity. Also, global uncertainties could see some companies postponing planned investments until a clearer outlook emerged, he added. </p><p> Strains on private sector consumption are emerging, some economists say, as the rate of non-performing loans for residential houses has risen and consumers tend to be cautious in an uncertainty environment.  </p><p> On the other hand, job security, based on the low unemployment rate, high agricultural product prices and historical low interest rates, are factors that would push consumption higher.  </p><p></p><p></p><p>\n",

      "<div align=\"RIGHT\"></div><b></b><p>AS of the end of last month, 19 recommendations of the <i>Financial Sector Masterplan </i>(FSMP) have been fully implemented, up from 10 implemented last year, the central bank said. </p><p> Excluding the recommendations being implemented continually over the FSMP's 10-year period, 77 have yet to be fully implemented. </p><p> Bank Negara said the focus under Phase 1 of the FSMP had been on building domestic capacity whereby a four-pronged strategy had been adopted. It was envisaged that that at the end of this phase, a core of strong domestic players would emerge and the gap between foreign and core banking institutions would be narrowed. </p><p> The thrust of financial policies this year would be to further enhance the position of domestic financial institutions to meet the more competitive environment that would emerge from the gradual liberalisation and deregulation which would take place during the second phase of FSMP. </p><p> It was envisaged that at the end of Phase 1, a core of strong domestic players would emerge and the gap between foreign and core banking institutions would be narrowed, Bank Negara said. </p><p> Among the completed recommendations were in the banking and insurance sectors, Islamic banking and takaful, development financial institutions (DFIs), alternative modes of financing and the Labuan International Offshore Financial Centre (IOFC). </p><p> As envisioned in the FSMP, the future financial landscape will be characterised by an increasingly more diversified financial sector to meet the requirements of a changing economic structure. </p><p> Efforts were also on enhancing the innovative capability, efficiency and market orientation of the IOFC. Last year, eight new banks, including two Saudi Arabian Islamic investment banks, were approved to operate in Labuan. </p><p> A total of 486 new offshore companies were incorporated last year versus 364 in 2001, up 33.5%. </p><p> The central bank said one of the strategic foci for the Labuan IOFC was to promote Islamic products and services given the growing interest in <i>syariah-</i>based financial and services products in the global financial market.  </p><p><a href=\"http://www.bnm.gov.my/en/Publications/ar.asp?yr=2002\" target=\"_blank\">Direct to the Bank Negara Report</a></p><p></p><p>\n",
