Keep in mind, \"garbage in, garbage out\". Feeding dirty data into a model will give us results that are meaningless.\n",

    "To decide which comedians to look into, I went on IMDB and looked specifically at comedy specials that were released in the past 5 years. To narrow it down further, I looked only at those with greater than a 7.5/10 rating and more than 2000 votes. If a comedian had multiple specials that fit those requirements, I would pick the most highly rated one. I ended up with a dozen comedy specials."
