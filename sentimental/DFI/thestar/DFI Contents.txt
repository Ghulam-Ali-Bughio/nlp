when prime minister tan sri muhyiddin yassin announced his stimulus package it appeared at first glance a commendable even an impressive feat by his government to respond to the covid19 pandemic however two key points merit assessment of the perikatan nasional governments response to this crisis first when muhyiddin addressed the nation remarkably enough he began by admitting that his government may not be the government you voted for this was an astonishing admission by the prime minister that he was aware many malaysians question the legitimacy of his perikatan government the second point was his resolve to use governmentlinked companies glcs to deal with the crisis this too was an intriguing admission that he as prime minister had control of powerful businessrelated governmentlinked institutions that he could deploy during this crisis indeed finance minister tengku zafrul abdul aziz would later draw reference to a government ecosystem according to the finance minister direct fiscal injection would come from government agencies and related parties in this ecosystem zafrul was not clear though of the source of borrowings by the government to fund this stimulus package muhyiddins admission of his control of major glcs that have funds and other resources to support people and businesses in need was an indication of two core matters first malaysia is a highly interventionist state with a welldeveloped institutional architecture to stimulate the economy and protect the interests of people in need second a politicalbusiness nexus is in place in government with the power that comes from such ties concentrated in the hands of the prime minister this influential ecosystem created in the 1970s to resolve social injustices though now critiqued as a moneypower nexus has long remained in the shadows in spite of repeated public demand for transparency about this government ecosystem no prime minister has been willing to do so even after the economic crises in 1997 and 2008 in this time of the covid19 crisis there is a particular need to analyse how this powerful politicalbusiness nexus is being – or not being – employed in this stimulus package what muhyiddin and zafrul referred to as glcs it must be stressed includes much more than publiclisted companies controlled by the government such as the utilitiesbased tenaga nasional and telecom and the financialbased maybank cimb rhb bank and bank islam this ecosystem includes pension and savings funds such as epf and pnb statutory bodies like mara and felda and development financial institutions or dfis such as sme bank exim bank and agro bank the prime minister has stated though with little clarity how some of these glcs will be employed tenaga nasional along with the government according to muhyiddin will offer a discount on power consumption that will amount to rm530mil telecommunications firms will offer free internet services with the government allocating rm600mil for this presumably glcs in these sectors will absorb these costs as for the glc banks they will offer loan moratoriums though this will not mean huge losses for them as these are merely deferred payments epf though a pension fund will allow for withdrawals to help people meet their expenses during this crisis most of these measures as well as other aspects of the stimulus package have already begun to draw much criticism why for example in this health related crisis have the glcbased hospitals not been included in this stimulus package glc hospitals such as kpj and pantai as well as those controlled by sime darby were not mentioned though muhyiddin called on private hospitals to help the government and what of pharmaceuticalsbased pharmaniaga as well as uemedgenta which provide healthrelated services indeed uemedgenta has been criticised for not treating its workers well during this pandemic there is no need for these major health financial and utilitiesbased glcs to worry about registering huge profits other criticisms have emerged particularly involving epf ngos have admonished the government for calling on malaysians especially those in the b40 to use their meagre savings to share responsibility to reflate the economy the sme association has reacted badly to the stimulus package claiming that 50 of such firms will wind down with at least four million people losing their jobs these smes constitute about 98 of the corporate sector since the finance minister has stated that the stimulus package will entail a reallocation of funds among governmentlinked agencies other related issues arise why not reallocate funds in dfis such as sme bank midf bank pembangunan and exim bank to small and micro firms which are in dire need to remain afloat why not employ agro bank and bank rakyat to help rural industries to ensure continued food production and supply and what about statutory bodies such as mara kesedar ketengah risda and felcra created to support small and rural industries these institutions have in fact been long abused for patronage and distribution of concessions to obtain political support indeed soon after the perikatan government took power it changed the board of directors of mara which has oversight of a huge business base there is a wellframed institutional architecture in this government ecosystem that has been used in the past to allow the government to intervene in the economy to achieve noble goals these businessrelated government institutions can be employed to get help quickly to the ground during this crisis there is however little indication in this stimulus package that the prime minister is using this government ecosystem effectively to deal with this pandemic in fact while trying to channel funds to people to increase consumption to sustain the economy the government appears equally preoccupied with helping major glcs remain profitable keeping a powerful politicalbusiness nexus in placeafter all the prime minister himself admitted in his speech he also has to deal with a political crisis if ever there was a time to expose this powerful glc world and for politicians to dispense with using this power nexus to consolidate their position in government it is now importantly too since this shadow governments ecosystem will be deployed to fuel the economy by an administration whose legitimacy is in question it is imperative that parliament be convened to debate this stimulus package prof terence gomez specialises in political economy and is the dean of the economics and administration faculty

pressure is mounting on the pakatan harapan government to prove its mettle after the country recorded its worst growth rate since the global financial crisis a decade ago economists have warned that the malaysian economy may continue to grow in the range of 3 in the first quarter of 2020 1q20 or even the first half 1h20  a far cry from the 61 growth seen in 3q17 the biggest threats facing the domestic economy in 2020 are the continued slowdown in the global economy and trade a prolonged novel coronavirus covid19 outbreak and commodity supply disruptions these threats coupled with weak business sentiment could weigh on growth further in 2020  for context the business conditions index as measured by the malaysian institute of economic research continues to be below the optimism threshold since the final quarter of 2018 ocbc bank economist wellian wiranto expects a 35 growth in 1q20 while alliance bank malaysia bhd chief economist manokaran mottain forecasts a growth of about 3 meanwhile maybank investment bank group chief economist suhaimi ilias predicts a sub4 growth in 1h20 before rebounding to above 4 in 2h20 this is assuming the outbreak is contained by june 2020manokaran expects the fiscal deficit to rise to 37 in 2020 exceeding the governments target in view of such challenges a stimulus package in the form of higher government spending and investments is a much needed catalyst to avert further economic slowdown finance minister lim guan eng said in a statement yesterday that prime minister tun dr mahathir mohamad will announce an economic stimulus package on feb 27 in response to the impact from the covid19 outbreak he adds that the economic stimulus package is neither a new budget nor part of budget 2020 measures instead assistance will be given to the affected sectors to allow the economy to emerge as whole as possible and benefit from the expected economic rebound postcovid19 according to lim the emphasis of the stimulus package would be on exploring alternative revenues such as shifting towards encouraging domestic tourism and sourcing from other marketsthis also involves keeping the domestic labour market resilient while ensuring our soft and physical infrastructure remain in place amid the shortterm weakened demand  lim says a fiscal stimulus if properly applied to the relevant sectors would improve market sentiment spur local demand and reduce economic losses caused by covid19 and the uschina trade war the problem is a fiscal stimulus on top of the governments budget 2020 would strain the governments cash flow and result in higherthanexpected fiscal deficit the government had previously forecast a 3 fiscal deficit level in 2020 but had later revised it to 32 malaysian rating corp bhd chief economist nor zahidi alias describes the move to contain fiscal deficit and introduce a stimulus package as a delicate balancing act while he concurs that fiscal consolidation measures are important to ensure the countrys sovereign rating is not compromised he says that a slightly higher deficit ratio during times like this will not hurt the economy rating agencies normally rate through the cycle and look at sovereign rating from a holistic angle – if the slowdown affects the global economy then they will see this as an unexpected event in this case it is unlikely that sovereign ratings will be affected  he tells starbizweek alliance banks manokaran expects the fiscal deficit to rise to 37 in 2020 exceeding the governments targetnor zahidi move to contain fiscal deficit and introduce stimulus package a delicate balancing act the government does not have to worry about fiscal deficit as many governments will inject more funds into the economy most of them will not be able to keep their target  he says on the governments fiscal stimulus package manokaran expects the value to be about rm7 bil to rm10bil manokaran has suggested several measures to be included under the fiscal stimulus package among which are  temporary reduction of the sales and service tax by half to 3  providing a voluntary option to cut employees contribution by at least 2 to the employees provident fund  increasing the tax claim for sponsorship of arts cultural and heritage activities in malaysia that could indirectly attract more tourists  government agencies and departments could hold conferences and meetings in hotels and resorts especially those with 3 and 4star ratings back in 2003 thethen government had introduced a stimulus package of rm73bil to deal with the economic impacts of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic under the stimulus package only 23 or rm17bil was funded by the federal government with the balance contributed by bank negara and development financial institutions such as bank simpanan nasional and bank pembangunan through micro credit schemes under various loan programmes with such an approach alliancedbs research says in a note the governments fiscal position was not materially impacted the support to the economy is not entirely reliant on the governments fiscal strength it also depends on the central banks ability to flex its muscles bank negara governor datuk nor shamsiah mohd yunus recently hinted at a possibility of cutting the overnight policy rate further pointing out that the central bank has ample room for monetary policy adjustmentssuhaimi points out that the economy will continue to see commodity supply disruption in q1 economists anticipate more rate cuts this year in the range of 25 to 50 basis points bps following a 25bps cut made earlier on jan 22 to 275  the lowest level since 2011the 4q19 economic performance the economic outlook has turned cloudier as the country merely reported a 36 growth for 4q19 much below the market prediction of 41 as for the fullyear 2019 growth was registered at 43  the lowest since 2009 and under the governments target of 47 however in an attempt to calm market fears nor shamsiah has insisted that the economy would have grown by 47 in 2019 and 43 in 4q19  if not for commodity supply disruptions for perspective palm oil production contracted by 169 yearonyear yoy in 4q19 natural gas production was down by 21 yoy while crude oil output remained in contraction of 5 yoy nor shamsiah also said that the economy continued to be supported by resilient private sector spending and the expansion in the services and manufacturing sectors private consumption which is the key support to the economy saw a stronger growth of 81 in 4q19 as compared to 7 in 3q19 meanwhile public consumption inched up marginally by 13 in 4q19 from 1 in the third quarter  as for investments public investments continued to contract albeit at a smaller decline of 77 in 4q19 however private investment posted a big jump with a 42 growth in the final quarter from just 03 in 3q19 commenting on the private investment trend wellian of ocbc bank has cautioned against reading exclusively on the yearonyear growth rate at 42 yoy in the fourth quarter the private investment does appear to have picked up considerably from 03 of 3q19 but in terms of contribution to headline growth investment activities still pose a net drag namely negative contribution of 016 percentage point albeit an improvement from 092 percentage point of the previous quarter even as foreign direct investment inflow has been encouraging especially into the technology cluster domestic investment activities appear to be still relatively subdued  he sayseconomic forecast wiranto expects a 35 growth in the first quarter of this year maybanks suhaimi points out that the economy will continue to see commodity supply disruption in 1q20 and hence affecting growth however he believes the low production situation will normalise beyond the first quarter on net exports nor zahidi of marc expects it to continue exert pressure on the economic growth in 1q20 as the tourism sector takes a hit postcovid 19 outbreak expenditures by foreigners or tourists in malaysia are considered as exports of goods and services  he says in 4q19 net exports declined by 98 after a growth of 159 in 3q19  he says


kuala lumpur bank pembangunan malaysia bhd bpmb and danajamin nasional bhd have received the approval of bank negara to commence negotiations under the first phase of the governments proposed merger involving the countrys development financial institutions dfis bpmb in a statement said that negotiations between the two dfis are expected to be completed within six months from bank negaras approval in budget 2020 the government had proposed to merge four dfis namely bpmb danajamin exportimport bank of malaysia bhd exim bank and small medium enterprise development bank malaysia bhd sme bank to strengthen the development finance ecosystem via a twophased restructuring plan to form a new financial institution the first phase of the restructuring plan will involve the merger of bpmb with danajamin and the second phase to merge exim bank and sme bank into the earlier merged entity the smooth implementation of the restructuring plan would be overseen by a steering committee led by the finance ministry the steering committee consists of representatives from credit guarantee corp malaysia bhd bank negara and the four dfis as well as relevant stakeholder ministries including the economic affairs ministry the entrepreneur development ministry and the international trade and industry ministry meanwhile a working committee which would provide updates on the merger progress would also support the steering committee in driving the implementation of the key integration aspects of the merger given the expected merger of the four dfis a banking analyst from kenanga research told starbiz that the merger is expected to largely tap the financing for entrepreneurs as well as smes driven by bpmbs mandate to provide medium and longterm financing to the strategic sectors of the economy right now getting financing for the sme sector is tough given the weak business sentiment hence conventional banks see the sme market and unsecured businesses as high risk to provide financing however this merger would extend its financing to the sme business which is a big market as it faces difficulty in getting financing from conventional banks  he added overall sme lending is seeing faster growth than total loan growth this year according to midf research senior analyst imran yassin bpmb was incorporated in 1973 with the role of assisting entrepreneurs involved in sme industries through the provision of various financing facilities training and advisory services particularly to bumiputra entrepreneursthrough its wholly owned subsidiary pembangunan leasing corp sdn bhd plc bpmb also provides financing to sme businesses including those involved in manufacturing construction supply transportation agriculture hospitality and information technology as of dec 312018 bpmb had a combined asset value of rm247bil reflecting that the group is wellpositioned to meet the financing and business development needs of malaysian businesses in the priority sectors with the global economy slowing down the analyst noted that merging danajamin could be useful in the merger as the bank would be able to capitalise the banking system should there be a rise in nonperforming loans moving forward this merger would strengthen the capital adequacy ratio so it can continue to expand its lending to the sme sector and unsecured businesses  he added the governments proposal to merge four dfis in the country could create an entity with a larger balance sheet that in turn could result in greater efficiencies and better cost controls however with these institutions serving different mandates the operational side would be something that the government would need to address according to industry players another likely issue that could crop up with the proposed merger is staffing where there will bound to be duplications and overlaps in some operations postmerger finance minister lim guan eng said in his budget 2020 presentation that dfis played an important role as public institutions that support the nations development goals and serve the needs and requirements of the new economy the possible merger of local dfis in malaysias already crowded and competitive banking space had been discussed sometime back but did not take off previously in a statement issued by bpmb it said that the proposal to strengthen the dfi ecosystem is a positive development our business lines are complementary to the other institutions and the proposal will lead to greater synergies that would benefit all stakeholders as well as fulfil the needs of the new economy  it added dfis in malaysia were established in the 1960s and 1970s as specialised financial institutions with specific mandates to develop strategic sectors spanning agriculture infrastructure smes as well as exportoriented and hightechnology industries notably in 2008 sme bank was made a separate entity from its parent company the bpmb group for the year ended dec 312018 bpmbs net profit fell 215 to rm16731mil due to higher allowance for impairment losses on loans and financing of rm42322mil versus rm30278mil a year earlier last year bank negara collaborated with the world bank and dfis to develop an enhanced performance measurement framework for dfis the central bank said it sought to provide a sharper focus in the mandates of dfis while optimising performance and synergies it aims to capture the broader contributions of dfis by moving beyond the narrow focus of financing growth indicators and integrating developmental key performance indicators to measure the socioeconomic impact of dfi operations

a week before the tabling of budget 2020 this column highlighted that the budget will likely be a nonevent as far as the market is concerned for the simple reason that the governments finances are tight and it cannot simply afford the many wishes of the wide range of stakeholderswhile economic projections came within expectations especially with respect to the budget deficit target of 32 and development expenditure of rm56bil the projected revenue and expenditure were off by 4 each as they came in higher than expectednevertheless the projected current balance of rm35bil was just slightly above the forecast rm3bilthe budget 2020 tabled last week is looking at economic growth of 48 which is within the expected range of between 45 and 5 it will be challenging given the expected growth is to be mainly driven by private consumption smaller contraction in public investment and but dragged by a drop in net exports as imports growth is expected to surpass exports next year on the supply side the significant contribution from the construction sector growth is not a surprise given some of the mega projects will likely kick off next year while the services sector too is expected to be sustained at more than 6 growthbudget 2020 had several hits and misses while it raised minimum wage to rm1200 it is still short of the rm1500 targetat the same time the call to widen the tax revenue base was not fulfilled the introduction of a new tax bracket of 30 for high income earners of above rm2mil a year is insufficient as it is only an incremental increase of two percentage points the finance minister failed to introduce or at least prepare malaysians to accept new taxes especially inheritance tax and capital gains taxthe property market got a major boost with the lowering of the threshold price to rm600000 from rm1mil for completed high rise condominiums and apartments that can be sold to foreign buyers beginning next year for a period of one yearhopefully this would help developers sitting on these types of properties and to clear the existing overhang in the market in addition the renttoown scheme is good for firsttime home buyers while the change in the base year for the purposes of real property gains tax rpgt to the year 2013 from 2000 is a welcome relief although still not widely accepted for administrative purposes it is always better to calculate rpgt to the year the property is purchased and not any base year as valuation of a property at a given point of time in history is very subjectivebudget 2020 was a positive surprise for those in the technology and in the electrical and electronics ee sector while the sin sectors were obviously sparred this time around with the exception of a reduction in special draws for the number forecasting operators nfo the proposed merger of the four development financial institutions dfi was another surprise and hopefully when that is done the merged entity will be the next mega ipo to be listed on bursa malaysiafor the environment as well as to promote green initiatives the proposals made under the budget are indeed welcome and could spur renewal energy further with the target to achieve 20 of energy production by 2025 the introduction of a 70 income tax exemption of up to 10 years to companies undertaking solar leasing activities could spur higher demand among consumersbut this could only happen if prices of solar panels became more attractive and the cost savings from the income tax reliefs are actually passed on to consumers the problem among consumers is the upfront cost of putting up solar panels on their roofs as it can be as high as almost rm4000 per kw peak or kwpmalaysia is also expected to see an accelerated pace of investments flowing into the country as the governments move to establish a special channel via investkl to attract investments from china is seen positive despite a temporary truce to the uschina trade war over the weekend nothing is certain just yet as to how the trade tariffs will pan out over the next few weeks placing malaysia as a destination of choice for foreign direct investments is crucial as it signals our readiness in attracting long term investments which can create job opportunities and generate economic expansion the setting up of the national committee on investment nci is also a step in the right direction to spur and expedite inward investment activitiesthe budget 2020 was indeed a comprehensive document covering all malaysians and indeed what better way than to focus on two main critical issues – cost of living and jobsthe budget did not fail in this aspect as there were various incentives to address cost of living issues including the newly introduced fuel subsidy mechanism a free rm30 ewallet deposit into accounts of entitled persons and last but not least a 18 reduction for plus highway users effective new years day next yearthe toll issue has dragged on for far too long and with the tabling of the budget 2020 we are now seeing some light at the end of the tunnel when the minister highlighted that the 18 reduction in toll translates to about rm113bil it seems to suggest that the current shareholders of plus the epf and khazanah are likely to forgo any future dividends with the reductionwith the commitment from the government that extension period for toll concessionaires is not going to be extended it is likely the two or three proposals that are siting on the desk of the minister or the prime minister will continue to collect dusttheir proposals while entailing even larger discounts than that proposed by the minister lack the commitment to end tolling in 2038 hence it is likely that their proposals are not going to see the light of day given the unspoken line it is now likely that either khazanah or the epf to take the lead to buy out one or the other logically as the ability to pay dividends to shareholders has now be diminished it would make sense for khazanah to acquire the 49 not already owned from epfall in the budget 2020 was a comprehensive document towards the governments new mantra towards shared prosperity vision 2030 it was for once a budget for the people and inclusive as well as far reaching kudos to the pakatan harapan government well donenow the tough and hard part – to implement the proposals as promisedthe views expressed here are the

introduction of the rent to own financing scheme will see up to rm10bil provided by financial institutions with support from the government via a 30 or rm3bil guarantee this scheme is certainly a welcome addition to help facilitate home ownership datuk khor chap jenpresident  ceo sp setia bhd  we applaud the governments initiatives to raise the ceiling price of homes made available under the renttoown scheme from rm300000 to rm500000 as this will give firsttime homebuyers more options to choose from the increase in the allocation for the scheme from rm1bil to rm10bil including a guarantee of rm3bil by the government shows that the government sees home ownership as a very critical issue for the rakyat however it is noted that under the current scheme only rm1562mil worth of loans was approved we hope the lending guidelines and criteria will be reviewed especially for firsttime homebuyers for them to benefit from the scheme the reduction of the foreign ownership threshold value for unsold stocks of condominiums and apartments located in city areas from rm1mil to rm600000 will help to reduce the overhang for these type of properties as developers can market these range of products to foreign buyers we hope that the state authorities will follow suit on this criteria the governments focus in improving the amenities and security for low and mediumcost stratified housing is very muchlauded as it will help to improve the overall standard of living for the residents currently residing in such developments tan sri leong hoy kum founder and group md mah sing group bhd  lowering the threshold of highrise property prices in urban areas from rm1million to rm600000 in 2020 will have a positive impact as foreign buyers are a blueocean pool of potential buyers which can reduce the overhang of properties in this price point we also appreciate governments willingness in listening to the market feedback and announcing improvement to the rpgt policy revising the base year for property acquired at jan 12013 for assets acquired before jan 12013 as compared to the previous base year of jan 12000 will allow sellers to pay lower rpgt the announcement of the new renttoown scheme is favourable towards first time home buyers who are facing difficulties in coming up with the initial 10 down payment and securing endfinancing as it serves as an alternative option for homeownership we appreciate the governments initiatives to help the youths and young married couples to own their first home by extending the bsn youth housing scheme from jan 12020 to dec 312021

implementation the government may need to address the reality of persistently high prices of basic food that has more to do with increasing food import bill the budget assures that the economic momentum remains with a 48 gdp growth expected next year contrary to the mainstream view that the world economy is moving into troubled waters warning lights come in the form of trade tensions geopolitical disruptions currency movements and growth deceleration of major trade partners i urge the government to be nimble and if outlook changes to come out with countercyclical measures that buffer the malaysian economy against deteriorating external environment and economic shocks

and behaviour of smes according to bank negaras annual report 2018 a total of 1529 formal sme businesses participated in the survey which covered firm and entrepreneur characteristics business performance and challenges as well as access to finance and usage of financial services the survey showed that more than 90 of the smes served the domestic market with 7 exporting their products and services about 83 of smes reported utilising information and communications technology ict in their business operations with 22 that have their own website and 14 that operate online stores more than half of the respondents 53 used professional services including auditors accountants or financial advisors to manage their financial accounts says the central bank despite the challenging business environment in the first quarter of 2018 the majority of smes 71 recorded profit margins of above 10 and were able to maintain positive cash flows says bank negara manufacturing firms reported higher levels of productivity and paid higher wages for new graduate hires compared to other sectors on financing the central bank says respondents reported utilising funds from a variety of sources both internal and external with own cash contributions being the main source among other funding sources about 27 of the respondents had facilities with financial institutions followed by family and friends internallygenerated funds and microfinance institutions in the microenterprise segment 22 had financing facilities with financial institutions including 9 of respondents who secured financing under the pembiayaan mikro facility bank negara says sources of financing also vary through the business life cycle at the initial stage young firms tend to rely on their own cash and informal sources such as family and friends this is consistent with most research findings which attribute such behaviour typical of young firms to information opacity lack of collateral track record and financial skills as well as high transactional costs as businesses mature typically after five years in operation they tend to rely more on external financing in the form of both debt and equity including bank financing among the smes that had applied for financing most indicated that they were able to secure financing says the central bank  about 22 of the respondents had applied for financing in the six months prior to the survey with the majority 94 of their applications being approved about 13 applied to financial institutions with 91 of their total financing applications approved while the remaining 9 applied to other sources with a 99 approval rate womenowned firms reported higher demand for financing 33 of womenowned firms applied versus 22 for all respondents but experienced a lower approval rate of 83 overall 94 mainly due to the lack of track record and insufficient documentation most of these firms obtained unsecured financing from microfinance institutions banking institutions and development financial institutions bank negara says adding that about 44 of the respondents were firsttime borrowers the main purposes of the financing applications were for the purchase of assets building property machinery and equipment 23 working capital 22 and starting a new business 19 on average the majority of the applications 89 was approved within one month and the funds were disbursed within the subsequent month says the central bank the survey also provided insights on smes usage of other financial services such as insurance takaful and epayments more than half of the respondents have insurance or takaful products although this was less prevalent among microenterprises  while the current takeup has been low potential future demand for insurance and takaful by smes is significant for all products across the board with emerging interest particularly in securing protection for risks associated with cyber security professional indemnity payment default and damages in crops the survey noted that smes mainly made electronic payments but preferred cash in receiving payments from customers it was also observed that cheques remained popular for payments to suppliers and other business to business transactions underlying challenges in financing with regards to challenges the survey reveals that financing barriers mainly relate to documentation costs and business viability among the key constraints to business growth difficulty in accessing sufficient financing was ranked low second to last out of the nine constraints

nonviable business plans as the main reasons for rejection smes involved in automation innovation manufactures of goods and exports experienced higher rejection rates compared to the overall smes firms that automated stated insufficient collateral and projects perceived to be of higher risk as key reasons for rejection the rejected applications were mainly for the purchase of machinery and equipment and ict tools as well as undertaking research and development bank negara says these projects could be deemed to be higher risk as they may involve moveable and intangible assets with low salvage value in the event of commercial failure and involve the use of new and untested processes with high uncertainty on returns innovative firms cited insufficient documentation as a key factor for rejection exporting and manufacturing firms that faced greater difficulty obtaining financing were mainly firms that were newly established with limited repayment track records businesses that

if we were to believe the hype whipped up by some politicians following the formation of the new government the malays in our country are in danger of losing everything planting fear and using race and religion has always been an effective emotional political weapon throw in threats of racial riots and soon the temperature shoots up it doesnt help when counter arguments come in the form of equally distasteful racist remarks these shenanigans usually only involve a handful of desperate politicians likely the ones who lost in the general election or are being investigated for corruption then there are some very loud cooperatives – presumably paid – who amplify their voices through social media only the ignorant would believe the incredible claims made up by these politicians in malaysia almost all the institutions are dominated by malays including the civil service police army and the government just take a cursory look at the racial makeup of the members of parliament and senators at the dewan rakyat and dewan negara of the countrys 30 millionplus population more than 60 are malays and those numbers will continue to grow while that of the chinese and indians keep shrinking the chinese population in malaysia has consistently been declining from the early days of independence from 376  in 1957 to 246 in 2010 and 214 in 2015 due to a lower birth rate as well as a high level of emigration in recent decades according to a news report in 2016 by 2030 the number of chinese – the second largest ethnic group after the malays – in malaysia will drop to third place after the bumiputra and foreign migrant workers a huge dip in the birth rate of the chinese to 14 babies per family in 2015 from 74 in 1957 and a sharp rise in the numbers of foreign workers are now threatening the chinese position as the second largest grouping in malaysia the report quoting projected data from the department of statistics said the population percentage of local ethnic chinese will shrink to 196 in 2030 from 246 in 2010 and 214 in 2015 the chinese percentage is also projected to fall further to 189 in 2035 in the report chief statistician datuk dr hasan abdul rahman said that although the chinese population will increase to 71 million people in 2040 from 66 million now the percentage compared to the malays and indians might decline to 184 in 2040 in terms of numbers the other two ethnic groups are projected to rise with the bumiputra outdoing everyone else the bumiputra population is anticipated to increase from 192 million in 2015 to 26 million by 2040 and indians from two million to 23 million the bumiputra population is anticipated to increase from 618 to 675 and indians from 55 to 64 this huge malay demographic simply means that the malay electorate will be significantly broad looking at the countrys 16 millionstrong civil service bernama reported in 2016 of then minister in the prime ministers department shahidan kassim saying that as of december 2014 the ethnic composition of the civil service was as follows 788 malays bumiputera sabah 61 bumiputera sarawak 48  chinese 52  indians 41  other bumiputera 03 and others 07 in the case of the powerful police force then home minister datuk seri dr ahmad zahid hamidi said in 2016 that the police needed more nonmalays to enlist as they currently make up only 5 of the 133212strong force of the total 8023 106871 are malays while chinese make up only 196 2615 indians 316 4209 punjabis 021 275 and others 1444 19242 he told parliament the malaysian army royal malaysian navy and royal malaysian air force are also overwhelmingly populated by malays according to a news report the malaysian army comprises 983 malays and 02 chinese with officers making up 962 out of which 14 are chinese thats a far cry from the preindependence days when the police especially had a decent number of chinese which was instrumental in our successful thwarting of the communist party of malaya cpm insurgents and urban terrorists it was the infiltration of these chinese policemen into the cpm with the many dangerous and highly classified covert operations of the police special branch and military intelligence which defeated the cpm from the 1960s to the late 1970s nonmalay armed forces personnel comprised about 30 of the total manpower while the navy and air force excluding the army had a higher percentage over the years this figure gradually dropped to the current 5 certainly no one is blaming the government for this situation since it has openly encouraged nonmalays to join the responsibility of defending the country and the people should be shared by all malaysians so it would be terribly unfair if this mammoth burden is only shouldered by the malays however a combination of factors including perceived low chances of promotion has deterred many nonmalays from joining the ranks despite the tiny representation of the nonmalays in the services especially the police the men and women in uniform have performed professionally nonmalays feel secure and protected even in the wake of incidents involving malay attackers and this must be remembered and in the case of the economy despite the large number of chinese businessmen who continue to be listed among malaysias richest it has long been acknowledged that the malays are now firmly in control of major banks governmentlinked companies glcs and top posts in the private sector according to prof dr terence gomez the glcs hold sway over some rm1 trillion 333 billion worth of investments according to his research the seven glcs control 35 of the top 100 listed companies in malaysia whose combined market capitalisation accounts for 42 of the market cap of all the listed companies on bursa malaysia many of these companies operate in key sectors of the economy such as utilities infrastructure property and telecommunications for example some of mof incs key assets and investments include petroliam

bhd astro malaysia holdings bhd malaysia airports holdings and malaysia airlines bhd but while these malays on the surface at least seem to be enjoying power and high income from governmentlinked companies many ordinary malays in the rural and urban areas sadly still struggle daily the years of affirmative action have created a broad base of the middle class which is crucial and essential for a stable malaysia but many of the effects have not fully trickled down to the destitute its these malays who need help the most and surely they are the most deserving too but wealth has been plundered and looted by corrupt politicians who are now preaching the politics of hatred to their audience cut off from the access of rational and sound arguments in bahasa malaysia the rhetoric of race and religion has found faithful listeners who buy into their bluff of malays being threatened and in danger of losing their rights in the country a privilege belonging to them solely and no other malaysians having a finance minister of chinese ethnicity and an attorney general of indian origin are enough to trigger fears never mind the fact that the government machinery is entirely malay and suddenly icred has taken over 1mdb as the prime issue of the country never mind if their listeners cant even pronounce the acronym and are largely clueless to what its all about but for some reason they seem convinced it takes away malay rights and islam politicians in this country including those in power now are no angels although they would like to be viewed as the new breed of malaysian politicians supposedly blind to race many have used the race and religion card themselves even staging massive protests but are now criticising the opposition for the same thing its a classic case of the pot calling the kettle black in some ways some of our new ministers have also failed to handle the civil service well given the crass way they have dealt with the more experienced and knowledgeable senior government officers instead of winning them over – as they too settle into the new political dynamic and culture – some inexperienced ministers with their newfound power and authority ignore their advice malaysia has been drained of copious amounts of money as a result of looting so we really have no time for any hysterics as we need to get back to the economy race and lift our heads high again

during the ge14 campaign period tun dr mahathir mohamad had famously referred to malaysias complex ownership structure of governmentlinked companies glcs as a monster  there was irony in this statement because dr mahathir after all had a played a leading role in crea­ting this structure that has enterpri­ses in every sector of the economy however he noted too that this structure was created to serve a noble vision but the glcs had evolved into tools exploited by politicians to serve their vested interests  there is undoubtedly a deep sense of frustration among malay­sians particularly business people about the pervasiveness of glcs in the economy  the contention is that the glcs crowd out private firms in key economic segments except the industrial and manufacturing sectors under barisan nasional there had been numerous promises to reform the glcs particularly during economic crises critics also note that the presence of influential politicians in the glcs has weakened managerial practices undermining the performance of these firms  through glcs corrupt politicians have channelled concessions to private companies in exchange for campaign contributions something must be urgently done about the glcs however what is brewing as malaysia embarks on an arduous journey of instituting reforms is a serious divide in opinion about how to deal with these glcs the most commonly articulated panacea is to privatise the glcs unfortunately it is not so simple this debate assumes a homogenisation of glcs when in fact there is a variety of such institutions that play different roles in the economy  how we got here the introduction of the new economic policy nep in 1970 precipitated extensive government intervention in the economy the nep was a progressive 20year affirmative action plan to eradicate poverty and equitably redistribute wealth between ethnic groups bumiputera corporate ownership then stood at a mere 15  government intervention entailed establishing public enterprises to acquire primarily foreignowned businesses these public enterprises later renamed glcs were also introduced at the federal and state levels to play a developmental role in the economy among these glcs were development financial institutions tasked with nurturing domestic smes funding ventures in new sectors and promoting rd  other glcs included sectoralbased institutions to achieve core development goals and socioeconomictype statutory bodies after dr mahathir was first appointed prime minister in 1981 he embarked on privatisation  par­tly to rid the government of the huge number of glcs but also to create a new breed of bumiputra entrepreneurs who owned business conglomerates of international repute he achieved this goal but the 1997 asian currency crisis unravelled his plans  the government had to renationalise many of these privatised companies creating again a public sector that owned a large number of glcs a plan was initiated to reform glcs mainly those listed on the stock exchange professionals from the private sector were hired to manage them while politicians were removed from their boards of directors these professionals most of whom had never served in government were paid salaries benchmarked against private sector remuneration an issue of much contention today  another criticism was that these executives were subservient to the dictates of the prime minister  one outcome of this reform was that these glcs emerged as leading firms since the turn of the century glcs have been among at least seven of malaysias top 10 listed firms glics and listed glcs glcs have however not evolved in a coherently linear direction they are required to fulfil a range of business and social duties implemented by different institutions at the federal level the glcs are primarily owned by five savings and investmentbased institutions the employees provident fund retirement fund inc lembaga tabung haji lembaga tabung angkatan tentera and permodalan nasional bhd sovereign wealth fund khazanah nasional bhd and the governments primary holding company minister of finance inc collectively termed as governmentlinked investment companies glics these seven vary considerably in size and objectives and are ultimately controlled by the finance minister through a complex pyramidtype organisational structure in early 2017 of the 900odd companies listed on bursa malaysia 70 were glcs that is those with a glic as the largest shareholder the 20 largest among these companies known as the g20 accounted for about 42 of the exchanges total market capitalisation what is of concern is that the government has substantial equity interests – ranging from 5 to 37 – in 140 listed firms however the government is not the largest shareholder in these companies instead the majority owners are individuals or foreign enterprises it is unclear why the government has sought to secure such huge shareholdings in these companies that it does not control this sort of equity ownership could well be in order to earn dividends from the companies but such shareholdings can lead to hostile takeovers business owners have long complained of expropriation of their companies by the government ostensibly as part of its equity redistribution exercise fear of expropriation has undermined investor confidence and hampered rd endeavours to shape globally competitive enterprises reforming the glcs given the scale and scope of government involvement in the malaysian economy urgent reforms are necessary to ensure the glcs function well and are taken out of the overwhelming control of politicians there is no one remedy to deal with this colossal governmentbusiness complex a thoughtful debate is imperative after a comprehensive study of these glcs in the short term institutional reforms can be formulated to ensure accountable and transparent governance of the companies specifically to address concentration of economic power in the finance ministry power has to be devolved to key oversight institutions such as bank negara the securities commission and oppositionled parliamentary committees within glcs autonomous technocratic professionals must be employed based on merit and not ethnicity so that inefficiencies and abuse of power can be curbed these professionals can be appointed by the finance minister who will have jurisdiction over these glcs though subject to parliamentary oversight in the long term as part of the glc reforms there must be a review of how statutory bodies holding companies and foundations function the government should consider the implications of the restructuring on a sectorbysector basis the modes of reforms to be considered include divestment where government presence is not necessary for example in construction media and tourism on the other hand the government would need to retain ownership of glcs in utilities banking oil and gas defence plantations airport services and ports  the transfer of ownership of huge firms in these sectors to private investors may not serve the nations interest however in these cases partial privatisation through the listing of the glcs has been proposed as a way to raise funds while extending equity ownership to private investors the government will retain control of these companies while reforms are being debated it must be considered that glcs have played an important developmental role creating a vibrant domestic privatelyowned enterprise base promoting mechanisms to encourage private firms to venture into new economic sectors and enhancing the development of rural and nichebased enterprises glcs must still play this role evidently a number of issues must be reviewed when reforming this interlocking nexus of government and business it is therefore surprising that the reformminded pakatan harapan government has yet to act on this matter even as debates about the glcs

kuala lumpur two weeks after the securities commission issued a stern warning to investors putting money into cryptocurrencies bank negara has now said it will be issuing its guidelines on the issue by yearend  bank negara governor tan sri muhammad ibrahim has been looking into the matter and the details as the new form of currency has attracted a lot of attention around the globe we hope to come out with guidelines on cryptocurrencies before the end of the year in particular those relating to antimoney laundering and terrorist financing we want to ensure that there are clear guidelines for those who want to participate in this sector he said on the sidelines of the global symposium on development financial institutions the central bank last commented on cryptocurrencies more than three years ago when a statement was issued on jan 2 2014 saying that bitcoin was not recognised as legal tender in malaysia and that it did not regulate the operations of bitcoin the public is therefore advised to be cautious of the risks associated with the usage of such digital currency it had earlier said china clamped down on bitcoin recently with news wire reports saying that the secondbiggest economy in the world had seen several large bitcoin exchanges closing down after the government there banned fundraising using the cryptocurrency meanwhile muhammad reiterated that the ringgit should always be reflective of malaysias economic strength and fundamentals what is important is not so much the level of the ringgit but that the ringgit must reflect the economic strength of malaysia if economic growth and inflation are under control then the exchange rates should reflect that muhammad said he said a companys competitiveness should not be solely derived from exchange rate weakness and should also be measured on other factors it is very important that the ringgit reflects our fundamentals we have been very clear to the cooperations that they should not just rely on the exchange rate for competitiveness they should also rely on productivity and innovation to sell to others and cannot just rely on exchange rates when marketing abroad muhammad said he also said the central bank was monitoring closely inflation levels given the rising local petrol prices the inflation numbers that we saw in the last monetary policy committee meeting is still within projections inflation numbers are very much dependent on global oil prices and so far we do not expect this to increase at such a rate that would have implications on inflation rate projections not yet he said but we are always keeping an open mind as the data comes in we will look at the implications on inflation and we will certainly disseminate this information as it comes in he added he said that with economic growth being entrenched and inflation sitting within the expected range it gives bank negara a little room for flexibility in terms of policy formation the next meeting is in early november and we will look at the data again to see where we should position the economy it is very important that our interest rate levels must be at a level that would promote growth and ensure inflation is managed strongly muhammad said in his speech muhammad said properly structured development institutions could be a potent agent of change for privatesector investment drive growth and forge inclusive societies  he said that more than ever today development financial institutions needed to step up to promote new growth areas  they should perform a broader role to stimulate economic activity that would not otherwise take place they could also improve the quality and scale of such activities they can provide unique value propositions in terms of advisory and nurturing new growth sectors to become profitable and thus attractive for private investors he said he highlighted the rise of the korean cultural phenomenon known as the korean wave or hallyu now a new growth area for the korean economy with the exports of culture content including films and music at an estimated value of us832bil this extraordinary rise of the korean wave can be attributed to the growth of investment in the creative industry the industry was boosted by the governments strategy to prioritise the sector as an engine of growth after the asian financial crisis he said the korean government had earmarked 1 of the national budget for development financial institutions to kickstart the sector following their footsteps domestic conglomerates like samsung and daewoo started investing in film financing and video production muhammad added he said this example showed that development financial institutions were the first to spearhead investments in the film and music industry  at that time commercial banks did not have the capability to assess the viability of the industry nor accept the intangible assets offered as collateral it was only much later when the industry recorded healthy profits that private investments followed he said the success speaks for itself between 2008 and 2011 private domestic and foreign investments in the culture content industry had quadrupled to more than us157mil

kuala lumpur properly structured development institutions can be a potent agent of change for private sector investment drive growth and forge inclusive societies said tan sri muhammad bin ibrahim governor of bank negara malaysia  speaking at a global symposium on development financial institutions the governor highlighted that development financial institutions need to perform a broader role in stimulating economic activity   they can provide unique value propositions in terms of advisory and nurturing new growth sectors to become profitable and thus attractive for private investors he said  drawing examples from the success of the korean cultral industry dubbed the korean wave and ugandas first private bond issuance by a multinational mobile telecommunications company muhammad said there were ways in which development financial institutions can be steered to contribute more broadly and strategically to economic development muhammad also highlighted the need to strengthen accountability frameworks through performance standards that emphasise development additionalities  performance measurement systems that accord greater quantification of development impacts will strengthen accountability frameworks with many attendant benefits it will further reinforce the governments developmental agenda it will provide a mechanism to address market failures it will ensure that funds are allocated to the right sectors within the economy   effectively done it will increase the development financial institutions credibility reputation and potential as key players in advancing socioeconomic development he added  muhammad also said development institutions should take the lead in providing solutions to stimulate investment and entrepreneurship  in my view a key part of their contribution to development has to be in evolving nontraditional approaches to encourage investments in targeted sectors precisely because conventional approaches have not responded adequately he said  finally muhammad said institutions can significantly increase their impact through resolving issues of corporate governance   the critical appraisal and monitoring functions are largely shaped by the strength of its corporate governance these require competent and professional boards to be installed clear rules of engagement with their stakeholders and stronger performance management standards that are aligned with development outcomes

compared with the 5 expansion in 2015  on a quarteronquarter seasonallyadjusted basis the economy recorded a sustained growth of 14 3q 2016 14 it said  the 45 growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the 42 expansion in 2016 were within the range projected by treasury  bnm said going forward the global economy was expected to improve but remain on a moderate growth path  while there are indications of more sustained growth in the major economies in 2017 downside risks to global growth continue to prevail arising from the volatility in commodity prices policy uncertainties and growth prospects of the major developed economies heightened risk aversions in the global financial markets as well as geopolitical developments it said   bnm said while the external environment might continue to remain challenging the malaysian economy will experience sustained growth with the primary driver being domestic demand   private consumption is anticipated to remain supported by wage and employment growth with additional impetus coming from announced government measures to support disposable income of households   investment activity will continue to be anchored by the ongoing implementation of infrastructure projects and capital spending in the manufacturing and services sectors it said  commenting on bnm said the q4 2016 growth was supported by the continued expansion in private sector expenditure   on the supply side growth continued to be driven by the manufacturing and services sectors   overall domestic demand expanded at a more moderate pace as the improvement in private consumption and investment activity was more than offset by the decline in public expenditure   in the fourth quarter private consumption grew by 62 3q 2016 64 supported by continued wage and employment growth   private investment registered a growth of 49 3q 2016 47 following continued capital spending in the services and manufacturing sectors growth of public investment improved mainly on account of higher spending on fixed assets by public corporation but nevertheless remained in contraction during the quarter   public consumption also declined by 42 3q 2016 22 arising from the rationalisation of spending on supplies and services and a moderation in the growth of spending on emoluments   on the external front net exports contributed positively to growth as real exports expanded at a faster rate than real imports   on the supply side growth in the manufacturing mining and agriculture sectors improved bnm said   in the q4 2016 the manufacturing sector expanded at a faster pace at 48 owing to higher growth in both domestic and exportoriented industries   the mining sector recorded an improvement of 49 due to the increase of natural gas production during the quarter   in the agriculture sector economic activity contracted at a slower pace at 24 reflecting the diminishing impact of el niño on crude palm oil yields   growth in the services sector continued to expand at 55 albeit at a more moderate pace supported mainly by consumptionrelated services   in the construction sector growth remained driven by the civil engineering subsector recording a growth of 51  bnm said that in q4 2016 the current account surplus widened due mainly to a higher trade surplus and narrower deficits in the income accounts  the central bank said as at jan 31 2017 the reserves position totalled us95bil rm426bil the international reserves remain ample to facilitate international transactions they are sufficient to finance 86 months of retained imports significantly higher than the 3month international threshold  total gross financing raised by the private sector through the banking system development financial institutions dfis and the capital market amounted to rm3162bil 3q 2016 rm2938bil   on the ringgit bnm said it depreciated by 76 against the us dollar during the quarter   the ringgit also depreciated against the euro 16 the pound sterling 24 and the australian dollar 25 but appreciated against the japanese yen 63   the ringgit also depreciated against all regional currencies with the exception of the korean won by between 21 and 56  bnm said the malaysian financial system remains resilient despite global uncertainties over policy adjustments in the major economies   the domestic banking system remains wellcapitalised with ample liquidity to support the financing needs of businesses and households   as businesses and households continue to adjust to the challenging economic outlook and higher cost of living these financial buffers will support the resilience of the financial institutions   it cautioned that going forward external events will continue to weigh heavily on the volatility of the domestic financial markets   bnm said these include increased uncertainty over political developments and growth in the major economies as well as volatile commodity prices   domestic financial system stability is nonetheless expected to be preserved given the loss absorption capacity of financial institutions supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers it added

it is on rising trend increasing 14 from three years ago mention corporate fraud and most malaysians will give a blank stare an impromptu survey done by starbizweek in kuala lumpurs central business district revealed the extent to which people know about corporate fraud of the 25 people 23 did not know or did not want to comment experts say that corporate fraud is on the rise but that is difficult to ascertain since most research depends on survey respondents perhaps the technology to detect such activities is better and the regulators have become more adept but it is for sure that globalisation of economic activities and technology have also played a part in making fraudulent activities harder to detect or prosecute kroll inc the new yorkbased corporate investigations and risk consulting firm says in a report that fraud is on an increasing trend up 14 in its kroll global fraud report 20152016 from three years ago the report noted that threequarters of survey respondents were victims in the past year the report also says that the number of companies weighed down in terms of financial loss arising from fraud has also increased to 69 last year compared with 64 in 2014  an interesting observation among malaysians is the equating of fraud with corruption while its not exactly the same there is often an element of corruption involved as in people being paid off to turn the other way while fraudulent activity is being committed creative accounting is usually what comes to mind among people who have any opinion at all about corporate fraud  vestra solutions managing consultant and certified fraud examiner gerald pillai points out that developing countries such as malaysia can see fraudulent activities rising especially in economically challenging times while baker tilly monteiro heng corporate advisory partner andrew heng pic says corporate fraud is becoming more complex and has become increasingly difficult for auditors to detect  he adds that this is complicated by organisations forming shell companies abroad to create a semblance of legitimate business transactions  you can create companies overseas and pretend to buy things from you on paper which could look normal until you see the place and there is nothing there  the level of detection and investigative work definitely will need to be increased which will make it even harder for auditors to detect it will not be something that you can instantly pick from the accounts heng says obviously any report on corporate fraud in malaysia cannot ignore 1malaysia development bhd 1mdb the controversial governmentowned strategic investment firm on july 20 the us department of justice doj announced a civil suit to seize more than us1bil rm402bil in assets allegedly linked to 1mdb  following the doj action deloitte malaysia 1mdbs auditor notified 1mdb of its intention to resign deloitte referring to the suit also noted that its audit reports for 1mdbs financial statements for the financial years ended march 31 2013 fy13 and fy14 can no longer be relied upon because of information in the civil suit that were not available during those periods 1mdb also sent out a statement saying that the audited financial statements for the periods concerned should no longer be relied on in light of the doj suit heng says the 1mdb case is not creative accounting per se but not having the right information on certain assets in certain companies that caused the auditors to withdraw their opinion  referring to the 1mdb case he says the role of auditors have become increasingly tougher and that there is need to give the client the benefit of doubt however in his experience most corporate fraud involving listed companies here will have an element of creative accounting with the intention of manipulating the share price  the transmile group bhd case from 2007 comes to mind this case saw company officials abetting in making misleading statements relating to the airfreight companys revenue in its unaudited consolidated results for the financial year ended dec 31 2006 heng says there is sometimes an element of moneylaundering involved prominent fraud cases among listed companies in malaysia in recent years include kenmark industrial co m bhd linear corp bhd and axis inc bhd all involving creative accounting in corporate malaysias history the bumiputra malaysia finance ltd bmf scandal of 1983 comes to mind as possibly the largest corporate scandal in the country then  the hong kongbased subsidiary of thethen bank bumiputra malaysia bhd provided loans to several shady companies including units of carrian holdings ltd a conglomerate involved in property finance and transportation  it involved the murder of a bank auditor and ultimately saw hong kongs largest bankcruptcy with the collapse of carrian the government also pumped in billions of ringgit to support bank bumiputra  despite there being a royal commission of inquiry set up for this scandal there were no prosecutions with bmf chairman lorrain esme osman living in exile until his death in london in 2011 gerald says fraud needs to be prosecuted rigorously or it becomes part of the corporate culture this sends a wrong message he asserts given the number of prominent corporate scandals in the country in recent years gerald has this to say i think of late we have this coverup sort of attitude where we can always fix things and get away with it it is not to say that nothing is being done where fraud committed by listed companies is concerned the securities commission in its annual report for 2015 shows that 74 of active investigations last year were devoted to insider trading with the remainder for other misconducts such as corporate governance issues fraud and market manipulation  however experts say that there are still weaknesses in the active pursuit and prosecution of corporate fraud cases  they say that the laws are sufficient but enforcement is weak  the statutes that cover fraud and corruption in the country include the malaysian anticorruption commission act 2009 the penal code development financial institutions act 2002 customs act 1967 and the election offences act 1954 it probably comes down to enforcement whether relevant authorities understand these complications  there is a corporate crime division in the police force and whether they want to beef up that division is important says heng  gerald stressed that the relevant authorities need to enforce the law without bias only then can people consciously see that fraud is being taken seriously experts such as heng say if bribery and corruption is lumped in with fraud then the levels of fraud committed in malaysia may be far higher

there was much concern for the people and investors on how malaysia can weather the storm arising from the continuous plunging crude oil price that hovers around us30 per barrel currently as budget 2016 was drawn up based on estimated oil price of us45 per barrel the pressing question raised is whether our government can deal with the mammoth challenge to source for other revenue streams and to cut the expenditure to sufficiently plug the oil revenue gap so as to stay on course in meeting the fiscal deficit and national debt targets of 31 and 55 limit of gross domestic product gdp respectively failing which the countrys sovereign rating may be downgraded resulting in a whole host of ramifications  it is a relief to know that the government is committed to attaining the fiscal targets set and i am pleasantly surprised this can be achieved largely by the rm9bil cut in the development and operating expenditure  the cut is laudable as the budgets operating expenditure had already been reduced by rm8bil when budget 2016 was first prepared compared with budget 2015  it is comforting to see greater discipline in public spending in the past the grouses were that only the rakyat were required to tighten their belts  it seems the revenue gap that needed to be filled is not as wide judging from the mere rm9bil cut on public expenditure  this could be due to the unexpectedly high goods and services tax gst collection of rm51bil since its implementation on april 1 2015 the original forecast for the entire 2016 was only rm39bil  we must acknowledge the introduction of gst is absolutely timely to cushion the adversity facing the malaysian economy  the governments economic transformation programme which also include subsidy rationalisation diversification to the service sector has reduced the countrys dependence on oil revenue from more than 40 of total revenue to 20 currently  it is heartening to note the government did not implement any measures which required the rakyat to fork out more money through income tax and a high in the gst rate doubling the compliance and auditing efforts on tax evaders and restructuring the selling channels in dutyfree islands to plug leakages are continuous actions to ensure unscrupulous businesses are taxed measures that were anticipated but did not materialise included the full withdrawal of labuan duty free status further rollback of tax incentives and hike in stamp duty rate  it is likely that such moves were not implemented as the priority of the government was to maintain a conducive and accommodative business environment to sustain the economy  the government is also providing a special tax relief of rm2000 for individual taxpayers whose monthly salary did not exceed rm8000 which will benefit two million taxpayers and cost the government rm350mil  the 3 reduction for employees contribution to the employees provident fund epf will increase market liquidity and purchasing power of consumers the epf cut would add rm8bil in disposable income to the countrys 138 million workforce and if the money is spent as investment or expenditure within our economy it would boost our gdp of rm12 trillion by about 065  the education and tourism sectors will benefit from the additional rm5bil allocation for study loans and the arrival of chinese tourists without visa respectively  smes and startups would also benefit from the rm6bil fund injected by the development financial institutions and governmentowned venture capital funds  other effective measures the government may consider moving forward include optimising the government sizeable workforce which stands at 16mil now  most of the commercial organisations locally and globally are embarking on rightsizing exercises to optimise resources utilisation and enhance competitiveness  ultimately for an economy to thrive the nations resources should be fully optimised land disposal can be a major revenue stream in the case of singapore government it reaped about s14bil in 2015 from the sale of land  we may fully adopt the public auction process practised by the singapore and hong kong governments  generally people are encouraged by the better than anticipated state of affairs of our fiscal position as well as the bold measures introduced especially on the rm9bil expenditure cut while more measures can be introduced to further consolidate and stimulate our economy  yee wing peng is the country tax leader of deloitte malaysia the above views are his own

malaysia restrategises to deal with current economic challenges this is a repeat of what happened to last years national budget  with global crude oil prices sliding to new multiyear lows malaysia  which derives a major portion of its revenue from petroleum sources  has been forced to revise its budget 2016 just three months after tabling it in parliament  and similar to what took place around the same time last year policymakers politicians bankers economists business leaders consumer advocates and journalists had congregated at the putrajaya international convention centre picc over the week to listen to prime minister datuk seri najib tun razaks special address on how the government is going to revise its strategies to weather the current economic challenges faced by the country did the recalibration of budget 2016 meet expectations well going by the reactions of economic stakeholders so far it appeared opinions range from fairly muted to slightly positive alliancedbs research chief economist manokaran mottain for one thinks it is the right move at the right time the governments revised macro targets and revision measures look realistic and progrowth manokaran explains noting that the review of budget 2016 appears targeted at two key macro headwinds facing the country that is depressed crude oil prices that have weighing on the governments fiscal position and subdued private consumption that could strain economic growth cimb research economist maslynnawati ahmad concurs saying we view the recent budget recalibration positively as it tries to balance the need to tighten spending and still be able to act countercyclically to prevent a sharper economic slowdown  the government realistically assumes a bigger shortfall to incorporate the need for relief measures for rakyat to support growth and did not again for second consecutive year attempt to cut back development expenditure as significantly as it always did in the past whenever faced with an unexpected revenue shortfall or increase in spending she explains  a banker with a local financial institution on the other hand says there is no hohum about it we are in a nochoice situation as the economic outlook has become dimmer  new targets and assumptions along with fresh stimulus measures have to be set to be more reflective of the present environment importantly we have to be prepared as we will likely see even tougher times ahead the banker who wants to remain anonymous tell starbizweek on the sidelines after najibs special address at the picc dimmer outlook indeed there are red flags in the economic horizon  depressed crude oil prices aside we are also looking at potentially slower global economic growth this year while world trade remains sluggish  domestically reports about people facing job cuts and retrenchments in certain industries and businesses experiencing drastic drop in sales are increasing three months ago the government still thought malaysias gross domestic product gdp had the potential to grow up to 5 in 2016  but now as highlighted in the recalibrated budget 2016 the government thinks malaysias economic growth will unlikely exceed 45 this year  the countrys gdp nevertheless is still expected to expand by at least 4 this year the best policy strategy now is to focus on growth manokaran argues applauding the governments initiatives to spur private consumption which accounts for more than 53 of the countrys gdp under the recalibrated budget 2016 the government has introduced several measures aimed at boosting household disposable income and alleviate the rising cost of living to support private consumption growth  these include allowing employees contributions to the employee provident fund to be reduced by 3 from march 2016 to december 2017 granting a tax relief of rm2000 to individual taxpayers earning rm8000 or less a month for the 2015 year of assessment and various initiatives to reduce cost of food and essential goods the key to support domestic demand is to boost private consumption by putting money into the pockets of consumers bank negara governor tan sri zeti akhtar aziz explains adding that domestic demand is expected to remain as pillar of growth for malaysias economy amid the soft external environment on whether bank negara would cut interest rates to boost the domestic economy zeti says the prevailing overnight policy rate of 325 remains accommodative enough to support growth whats more important for the countrys economy now is liquidity and thats why we have reduced the statutory reserve requirement srr she explains the srr which is a requirement imposed on commercial banks to ensure that a portion of their funds are placed with the central bank will be reduced from 4 to 35 with effect from feb 1  this measure is expected to inject rm61bil of liquidity into the banking system weak sentiment midf research meanwhile thinks that although some of the new measures under the revised budget 2016 could help cushion the economic slowdown they may not be able to stimulate stronger economic activity due to the critically weak consumer and business sentiment as it is consumer confidence in malaysia has already hit a new low given the poor outlook on the job market and income growth while cost of living continues to increase according to the malaysian institute of economic research mier the consumer sentiment index csi plunged to a record low of 638 points in the fourth quarter of last year  notably the csi has been hovering below the 100point threshold which demarcates between optimism and pessimism since the fourth quarter of 2014  local businesses are also quite pessimistic about the current economic situation  while there is slight improvement in their sentiment business condition index remains in the negative territory at 871 points in the fourth quarter of 2015 analysts point out that there are not many new measures to directly address the needs of the private sector  the only notable one is the rm6bil increase in allocations by development financial institutions and government venture capital funds to benefit startup companies however they reckon that there are already sufficient existing measures to support the private sector  furthermore they note the recalibrated budget 2016 is not a new budget but remains in line with the initiatives and allocation that had been proposed when the original version was unveiled last october fiscal discipline the recalibrated budget 2016 is based on two basecase scenarios one with brent crude which is the international oil benchmark averaging at us30 rm12450 per barrel the other with brent crude averaging at us35 per barrel  this compares with the average oilprice assumption of us48 per barrel used for the original budget 2016 according to secretarygeneral of treasury tan sri mohd irwan serigar abdullah malaysia can withstand sustained oil price decline to us25 per barrel  as long as oil prices remain above that level the country will be able to sustain its economic growth and the recalibrated budget 2016 will remain  but if oil prices were to go any lower than us25 per barrel irwan reckons that there will be great challenges not only for malaysia but also for the global economy brent crude was traded at around us34 per barrel yesterday last week prices of the commodity fell to a 13year low of around us28 per barrel in line with the depressed oil prices the recalibrated budget 2016 projects the governments revenue to decline by 3542 to rm2163bilrm2179bil compared with the originally estimated rm2257bil while its total spending operating and development expenditure will be cut by 3036 to rm2557bilrm2572bil from the initially proposed rm2652bil cuts to operating expenditures are positive in the medium term in our view given the relative difficulty in trimming this spending nomura research says  we are also not overly concerned by cuts in the development spending budget – as we have argued while malaysias public capex disbursement rates are high relative to the rest of the region it is usually less than 100 with an average development spending disbursement rate of 92 between 2011 and 2014 it adds meanwhile manokaran says while the government has been relatively silent on the specific operating and development expenditure it is targeting to slash the commitment to achieve the 31 fiscaldeficittogdp target should augur well for the countrys sovereign rating standings we believe that the credit rating agencies would be content to see this commitment he says  looking ahead though manokaran reckons that the fiscal challenge of balancing the budget by 2020 remains  the government will have to keep future budgets lean as the depressed crude oil price level could remain for a while he explains

kuala lumpur prime minister datuk seri najib tun razak delivered a revised budget 2016 at putrajaya international convention centre  here is the full text of his speech  ladies and gentlemen  i introduction  1 alhamdulillahi rabbil alamin wa bihi nastain blessings and peace be upon prophet muhammad saw  2 i begin by reciting the translation by the ulama with reference to the words of allah taala in surah alinsyirah that with each difficulty surely there is ease or happiness  3 we should place such confidence in ourselves as well as in the administration and management of the government  4 as the old malay saying goes the coast changes with the tide thus i wish to make a special address today as the 2016 budget is also subject to challenges in the global economic environment  5 today

decades  6 we are grateful to allah swt for among those present today are leaders and administrators civil servants captains of industry corporate figures representatives from foreign missions nongovernmental organisations ngos and volunteers  7 all are here today for this special address to understand the governments action in recalibrating and restructuring several economic measures particularly with regard to the 2016 budget  8 of importance the recalibration and restructuring of the budget are centred on two main pillars first to ensure the economy remains on a strong growth trajectory and second to protect and safeguard the welfare and wellbeing of the rakyat  9 in tandem with the people first concept the measures that i will announce soon is a comprehensive summary after taking into account ideas and views that i have received  10 this was complemented by several engagement sessions with various economic stakeholders including governmentlinked companies glcs economists as well as industry experts  11 the government has also received excellent ideas from various levels of ngos representing consumers esteemed businessmen and directors of commercial banks  12 the majority of them are here with us this afternoon thank you for your input  indeed we are all doing this together for our nation  ii comparison of the economic scenario since 19971998  13 first let us reflect on the economic scenario during the asian financial crisis from 1997 to 1998  14 in 19971998 the country experienced an economic recession with gdp recording a negative growth of 74  15 we should not forget that among the significant effects of the recession were the sharp retrenchments increase in inflation reduction in international reserves to rm59 billion and the kuala lumpur stock exchange klse index plummeting to reach 260point level  16 many companies went bust furthermore some of our children including sijil pelajaran malaysia spm school leavers and young graduates had their dreams and aspirations to continue their studies abroad crushed as the government then could not afford to finance them  17 given the situation the leadership of the government then took drastic measures including implementing capital controls and currency pegging the ringgit at 380 to the us dollar  18 banking institutions were rationalised and private sector loans were restructured through the establishment of danaharta and danamodal the government also implemented a stimulus package of rm7 billion to revive the domestic economy  19 the nation again faced an economic recession in 20082009 due to the subprime crisis in the us which impacted the global economy as well as the steep increase in global crude oil prices reaching usd130 per barrel compared with an average of usd70 per barrel in 2007  20 the countrys exports declined by more than 15 this affected consumer and business sentiments  21 during that time i had just been appointed as the minister of finance and without hesitation took immediate measures by announcing the first economic stimulus package amounting to rm7 billion in november 2008  22 a few months later a second stimulus package of rm60 billion was undertaken in march 2009 to continue to stimulate domestic economic activity the second stimulus package also involved initiatives and collaboration between the government and the private sector  23 in addition to the stimulus packages upon assuming the nations leadership and until today the government planned and implemented several initiatives under the national transformation policy ntp  24 the government launched the government transformation programme gtp and the economic transformation programme etp to elevate malaysia to a developed and highincome country by 2020  25 among the achievements of the transformation include strong gdp growth averaging 56 reduction in government fiscal deficit from 67 to 32 as well as manageable inflation rate  26 we are grateful that hardcore poverty has almost been eradicated in addition 18 million job opportunities were created and rakyat 1malaysia initiatives and programmes were introduced such as 1malaysia people assistance bantuan rakyat 1malaysia or br1m 1malaysia book voucher baucar buku 1malaysia or bb1m kedai rakyat 1malaysia kr1m klinik 1malaysia and affordable housing  27 life is not always smooth sailing looking back at the scenario in 2015 malaysia faced several daunting challenges that were unexpected and beyond our control  28 crude oil prices declined from usd100 in 2014 to usd48 per barrel in 2015 crude oil prices have since continued to fall resulting in the recalibration of the 2015 budget  29 last year the countrys oilrelated revenue fell by almost rm14 billion thus on 20 january 2015 on behalf of the government i presented the recalibration of the 2015 budget by rationalising government expenditure as well as revising the fiscal deficit target from 3 to 32 to gdp  30 i would like to emphasise that the recalibration of the 2015 budget was supported by initiatives such as the rationalisation of fuel subsidy which was implemented earlier although it was an unpopular decision  31 all praise is due to allah these measures have been successful in mitigating the impact from declining oil prices and global economic uncertainties  32 indeed international rating agencies such as moodys standard  poors and fitch remain confident in the nations strong economic fundamentals and financial position by maintaining a good credit rating  33 based on these factors i am confident that the economy will record a growth of 5 and the fiscal deficit at 32 of gdp as targeted for 2015 the gdp growth for 2015 will be announced next month  iii latest economic scenario  34 the global economy is expected to be more challenging in 2016 the latest data by the international monetary fund imf indicates that the global economy will grow at a slower pace from 36 to 34  35 meanwhile world trade is anticipated to moderate from 41 to 34 this is on account of several economies such as south africa the us brazil and china which are also expected to grow at a slower pace  36 this trend proves that we are not alone in facing the global economic challenges other countries too are affected by the current economic uncertainties  37 world crude oil prices have continued to plummet below usd30 per barrel as of yesterday dated brent crude oil prices dropped to usd31 per barrel a reduction of 35 compared to the assumption of usd48 during the tabling of the 2016 budget  38 these developments have a significant effect on the nations revenue the economy of oil producing countries has also been adversely affected  39 furthermore the us dollar continues to strengthen compared to other currencies among the currencies affected are the brazil real 232 china renminbi 57 canadian dollar 113 russian ruble 293 and singapore dollar 56  40 meanwhile the ringgit too has depreciated by 113 against the us dollar from 377 in june 2015 to 425 on 27 january 2016  41 in fact the ringgit is undervalued and does not reflect the true economic fundamentals however the ringgit is expected to better reflect the strength of the economic fundamentals when global financial markets stabilise and oil prices recover to more reasonable levels  iv new measures  42 these developments have increased uncertainties in the global economy and impacted the domestic economy as well as resulted in the rising cost of living of the rakyat  43 recognising this and as a responsible head of the government together with the deputy prime minister and cabinet ministers today we are taking proactive action to announce the implementation of measures under the recalibrated 2016 budget  44 these initiatives are very important to ensure sustainable economic growth and more importantly to safeguard the wellbeing of the rakyat i am confident that together we can overcome these difficult challenges again  we have done it before god willing we can do it again  45 similar to the situation last year i wish to reiterate that the nation is neither in economic nor technical recession  46 in fact with our efforts and prayers the domestic economy continues to remain strong and resilient capable of facing global economic uncertainties  47 in addition to the measures in the 2016 budget i am pleased to announce 11 restructured and recalibrated measures to ensure the economy and financial position remain on the right trajectory  48 measure 1 the government agrees to reduce the employees contribution to the

assures it is committed in the education and future of our children in this regard the government agrees to continue four programmes under the sponsorship of the public service department psd for 2016 as follows  first the national scholarship programme for 20 top spm students to pursue study at renowned universities globally  second the special engineering programme for 200 students to japan korea

into consideration the current economic scenario the government has decided to revise the 2016 forecast of gdp growth to 4 – 45 and the assumption for average dated brent crude oil price at usd30 to 35 per barrel  second the government is committed to fiscal consolidation measures for 2016 that is to achieve a fiscal deficit target of 31 to gdp  third the national debt level will continue to be

rate at a level that supports domestic economic activity and  sixth ensure sufficient liquidity in the financial system recently bank negara malaysia bnm announced a reduction in statutory reserve requirement srr from 4 to 35  72 clearly the government will not waiver from its stance on fiscal and monetary policies to ensure the strength of the economy  73 the government is also concerned over the lifestyle of the rakyat who live beyond their means in this regard the credit counselling and debt management agency akpk under bnm will assist borrowers with difficulties in managing their debt obligations through restructuring their existing loans the good news is that all these services are provided free  74 for viable smes and companies that face financial problems due to the current environment the government provides a negotiation mechanism through the small debt resolution scheme and the corporate debt restructuring committee under bnm  75 in terms of investment i wish to emphasise that the government remains committed to achieving the targeted private investment totalling rm215 billion this year  76 for example the implementation of major projects such as mass rapid transit mrt and light railway transit lrt panborneo highway malaysian vision valley cyber city centre rapid pengerang and highspeed rail will be continued  77 to enhance strategic linkages between urban and rural areas the government will build another 10 urban transformation centres utcs in labuan sungai petani miri sibu kota bharu kuala terengganu tawau keningau seremban and kangar  78 in addition four new rural transformation centres rtcs are expected to be completed this year in jawi pulau pinang rembau negeri sembilan sungai rambai melaka and betong sarawak  79 to penetrate international markets matrade and sme corp will intensify the midtier and goexport programmes in addition to enhance the credit guarantee facility for trade exim bank will increase its funds for financing by rm500 million  80 as a trading nation with an open economy the government will expand exports to other markets we have to explore new markets through participation in free trade agreements ftas such as the asean economic community aec and the transpacific partnership agreement tppa as well as the upcoming regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep  81 with regard to the tppa which was passed by dewan rakyat late yesterday the allegation by some quarters that we have compromised national sovereignty and were apologetic in defending the bumiputera agenda during the negotiations with tppa members were unfounded  82 it is noteworthy that the governments efforts and firmness during the negotiation process with the members of the tppa have resulted in the acceptance of the bumiputera policy as part of the terms of the agreement at the international level  83 thus the bumiputera agenda is no longer a national agenda but has now been elevated and recognised globally  v conclusion  84 an advanced nation is not solely due to good and appropriate policies but also the contribution from all segments of society  85 we all have a shared responsibility irrespective of the private sector government ngo youth and women and regardless of whether one is a chief executive officer director support staff worker or a small sundry shop owner  86 overall the five key salient points are summarised as follows  first the recalibrated measures announced are proactive transparent and realistic in tandem with the current global economic challenges  second the economy remains resilient and continues to expand driven by domestic economic activity  third the wellbeing of the rakyat will continue to be prioritised and government service delivery will not be compromised  fourth the government is committed to implementing the fiscal consolidation measures and  fifth the recalibration of the budget is centred on the principle of shared responsibility from all segments of society  87 in brief the restructuring and recalibration of the 2016 budget is similar to last year it is not a new budget it is within the range of initiatives and allocation of the 2016 budget approved by parliament  88 it is clear that matters related to the nations economy and finance is not easy to digest and understood by all levels  89 in fact these issues are not solely the responsibility of the nations administration at the highest level  90 borrowing the words of wisdom from the learned ones in life and livelihood in a country with a government everyone must play his part helping each other through thick and thin that is our source of strength  91 hence i hope that every segment plays its part in explaining the current economic situation and initiatives of the government to further strengthen the economy as well as safeguard the wellbeing of the rakyat  92 this means that all groups from the government administration to the learned ones need to explain in greater detail the current situation and challenges to all parties from top to bottom engaging in discussions in mamak stalls over teh tarik to the best of their abilities  93 with that we hope our great grandchildren will recognise all our achievements for malaysias continuity which is not our right but the right of the future generation  94 we hold to the saying of the elders it is better to be silent rather than speak empty words and to give voice to useful matters do not ask what the nation has done for you but ask what we have done for the nation  95 in essence the challenges confronting us currently are not due to the failure of the government to plan but are on account of the global economic crisis which is beyond our control  96 indeed every decision that we make today is the best for the rakyat and will surely be recorded in history furthermore malaysia is neither a failed state nor a bankrupt nation as alleged  97 in fact the reality is the economy is stable with

special remarks by yab dato sri mohd najib bin tun haji abdul razak prime minister of malaysia special address on current developments and governments financial position   bismillahir rahmanir rahim  assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh dan salam 1 malaysia yab tan sri muhyidin yassin timbalan perdana menteri yb dato seri ahmad husni hanadzlah menteri kewangan kedua ybhg tan sri dr ali hamsa ketua setiausaha negara 4   introduction 1 first and foremost let us express our infinite gratitude towards allah swt for with his blessings we are able to gather this morning we also pray for the great prophet muhammad saw 2 we are here this morning with leaders and administrators civil servants industry players and corporate members representatives of embassies ngos and volunteer groups as well as the rakyat in this hall and those watching tv or listening to the speech 3 i would like to address some concerns on the current economic developments and the governments financial position lately there have been reports concerns and queries on issues such as crude oil prices and performance of the ringgit 4 the government has been vigilantly monitoring the situation in this regard i will announce several proactive measures to realign our policies in line with the changing global economic scenario which is beyond our control we are undertaking this to ensure that we continue to achieve creditable growth 5 in other words i am here today to announce specific and proactive measures to align ourselves with the recent global economic developments 6 we are not in crisis indeed we are taking preemptive measures following the changes in the external global economic landscape which is beyond our control 7 this is to ensure that our economy continues to attain a respectable and reasonable growth and at the same time we want to ensure development for the nation and rakyat continues 8 indeed 2014 was a year of trials and tribulations for us due to several tragedies 9 at the end of last year malaysia was hit by unprecedented floods affecting several states including kelantan terengganu pahang kedah and perak 10 although the floods were not so severe in johor sabah and sarawak local communities in some areas were affected 11 thus it is said that while man plans allah swt plans too and allah swt is the best of the planners 12 the government has always done its best to plan formulate and implement policies and measures for the betterment of the rakyat 13 it has been three months since the 2015 budget was tabled the budget was formulated based on first price of dated brent was forecast at usd100 per barrel 14 second gross domestic product gdp growth estimated between 5 and 6 third a stable exchange rate of rm320 against the us dollar and 15 fourth 2015 world economic growth was projected at 34 and 39 by the world bank and imf respectively since then the world bank and the imf have revised global growth to 3 and 38 respectively 16 it should be noted that budget 2015 was formulated based on strong economic fundamentals in 2014 therefore the fiscal deficit was forecast from 35 in 2014 to 3 of gdp in 2015 17 however the external situation has changed lately and we are impacted directly as malaysia is among the largest trading nations in the world 18 compared to the situation a few months ago the global economic landscape has since changed significantly this necessitates us to review and clarify some of our earlier macro and fiscal assumptions 19 among the issues raised is the governments ability to achieve its fiscal targets for 2015 given the current situation the question is whether the economy and governments financial position will be affected 20 in this special address i will explain to the rakyat and announce several measures to mitigate the current economic situation 21 as a responsible government we will continue to ensure economic development and safeguard the wellbeing of the rakyat declining crude oil prices 22 we are aware of the concerns among the rakyat business community and analysts over the impact of the sharp fall in crude oil prices on the domestic economy 23 over the last six months global crude oil prices have plunged more than 50 among others due to oversupply amid weak demand 24 leveraging advances in technology shale oil and gas output has risen significantly in the us 25 the situation is exacerbated by higher output from nonopec organisation of the petroleum exporting countries opec is also not willing to undertake production cuts in order to maintain its market share 26 the government has consistently reiterated that crude oil prices are beyond its control 27 the benchmark dated brent crude oil price has dropped to around usd48 per barrel on 19 january 2015 and analysts expect oil prices to take quite a while to stabilise benefits of declining crude oil prices 28 lower crude oil prices benefit net oil importing countries like malaysia 29 for instance the recent reduction in pump prices of petrol and diesel by 35 sen and 30 sen per litre respectively will increase the overall disposable income of consumers by rm75 billion assuming that consumers spend 40 of this amount it will boost private consumption by rm3 billion 30 the world bank estimates that lower crude oil prices will have a positive impact on world gdp in fact a 30 decline in oil prices could boost global gdp of up to 05 31 this bodes well for malaysias manufactured products further with the us economy strengthening there will be sustained demand for our exports in particular electrical and electronics ee products falling crude oil prices will reduce federal government revenue 32 in contrast falling crude oil prices will reduce government revenue the revenue is used for development purposes such as building of schools roads and houses of worship it is also used for other expenditures such as salaries of civil servants cost of medicine in government hospitals agriculture subsidies and expenditure for security including armed forces police and rela 33 in 2014 dated brent reached its highest level at usd115 per barrel on 19 june global crude oil prices have since plummeted by more than 50 34 consensus among economists is that the forecast price of usd100 per barrel used in the 2015 budget is no longer realistic they now estimate the average oil price in 2015 to range from usd40 to usd70 per barrel 35 the government has therefore revised downwards its forecast for the average baseline oil price to usd55 per barrel for 2015 36 based on the crude oil price of usd100 per barrel coupled with savings following the implementation of the managed float pricing mechanism for retail fuel prices effective from december 2014 the government is expected to get an additional operating surplus of rm37 billion 37 if crude oil price remains at usd100 per barrel the government will be able to accommodate all the measures announced in budget 2015 with the fiscal deficit target not exceeding 3 of gdp 38 however at the forecast price of usd55 per barrel there will be a revenue shortfall of rm138 billion 39 if we compare the revised figures with budget 2015 tabled in october last year despite the savings of rm107 billion from the implementation of the managed float mechanism for retail fuel prices the government still faces a revenue shortfall of rm83 billion to accommodate the 2015 budget measures 40 without any fiscal measures the deficit will increase to 39 of gdp against the target of 3 for 2015 41 this requires the government to take measures to reduce the deficit in line with the governments commitment towards fiscal consolidation 42 therefore taking into account the revised estimates we are revising the fiscal deficit target to 32 of gdp in 2015 43 this is still lower than the fiscal deficit of 35 of gdp in 2014 in view of the external factors we have to acknowledge that we may not be able to achieve the earlier fiscal target of 3 of gdp as announced of importance is our commitment to continue reducing the fiscal deficit from 35 of gdp 44 more importantly we will not compromise on national development planning as it will enhance productive capacity of the economy we will not neglect the rakyats welfare particularly the bottom 40 of households volatile capital flows and ringgit 45 the fluctuations in the ringgit are influenced by developments in the global economy hence the ringgit is not the only currency to have weakened against the us dollar in fact almost all currencies in the region have softened against the us dollar since september 2014 46 the recent volatile capital flows and significant depreciation of the ringgit were also due to concerns over the impact of the sharp fall in oil prices on the malaysian economy 47 in relation to this we must closely monitor the following first the current account in the balance of payments must remain in surplus second continue with fiscal reforms and consolidation and third economic activity must be further diversified to enable us to cope with falling crude oil and commodity prices 48 the government is confident that the exchange rate will over time adjust to reflect the strong economic fundamentals of importance our financial system continues to function in an orderly manner 49 most importantly there has been no disruption to financial intermediation with lending activities continuing smoothly businesses continue to have access to financing from banking institutions and the capital market 50 in essence greater policy flexibility adequate international reserves deeper and more diversified financial markets sound banking system and strong domestic institutional investors such as the employees provident fund will increase resilience to volatile capital flows current account balance 51 the current account balance is directly related to the import and export of goods and services 52 we are a crude oil exporter thus when oil prices plummeted recently there was a perception that export receipts will also decline drastically and result in a current account deficit 53 indeed this perception is not correct as a net crude oil exporter we had a surplus of rm77bil from january to november 2014 54 however we are an importer of petroleum products with a net import bill of rm89bil during the same period 55 if we include both crude oil and petroleum products we are actually a net importer with a deficit of rm12bil 56 therefore the perception that malaysia is a large oil producer is also not true 57 however if we factor in exports and imports of crude oil and nett out petroleum products then malaysia is a net importer of petroleum this does not include lng for which malaysia is a net exporter 58 furthermore we are still resilient as our diversified economy is able to weather the decline in oil prices 59 with a better outlook for the global economy in 2015 the shortfall in commodity receipts is expected to be cushioned by increased demand for manufactured goods such as electrical and electronic products woodbased products textile products and others which account for 76 of total exports meanwhile crude oil exports account for only 45 of total exports 60 therefore the government is confident that the current account will remain in surplus this year although smaller in the range of 2 to 3 of gross national income or gni in 2014 the current account balance is estimated to record a surplus at 51 of gni strategies to strengthen economic resilience 61 as i have explained earlier there are several issues which will impact

petaling jaya a move to restructure the governments housing loan division will shave the fiscal debt and possibly raise housing loan growth by commercial banks analysts are expecting the government to transfer rm42bils worth of civil servant housing loans into the banking system whereby staff will pay the normal 4 per annum and the government will subsidise any interest above that threshold all commercial banks are also expected to be eligible to participate in providing housing loans for government servants and analysts expect the transfer of loans to commercial banks and development financial institutions will lower total federal government debt by around 4 to 45 from 518 of gdp as of june 30 2013  the idea to restructure the governments housing loan division was first mentioned in last years budget as part of efforts to consolidate the fiscal deficit and to ease the governments financial burden during the budget speech it was mentioned that the government would appoint panels from commercial banks to manage new housing loans effective january 2013  but this had yet to implemented said a local research house  the research house reckoned the staff housing loans would be transferred to governmentowned development financial institutions such as bank rakyat bank simpanan nasional agro bank and bank pembangunan which will manage and administer the existing stock and future stream of civil service home loans  another a local bankbacked brokerage analyst said whether it made sense or not for banks to be allowed to handle government staff housing loans would much depend on the profitability of such loans banks should take into account whether in the long term it is profitable to do so after weighing in various factors such as its capital consideration and interest rate environment among others he told starbiz he said the treasury housing loans charged a flat rate of 4 compared with between 42 and 43 for new home loans by commercial banks and it would all depend on whether banks make a profit after taking into consideration the above factors over the long term an industry observer said the move could uplift loan growth in the banking system coupled with other positive factors if some of the rm42bil were to be transferred to commercial banks  another bankbacked analyst said the transfer could be positive for the banking system as the recent measures to shorten the tenure for mortgage and personal loans as well as the potential fiscal tightening by the federal government via subsidy rationalisation programme in the later part of the year could dampen loan growth momentum in the retail segments this move to transfer could to an extent boost loan growth in the banking system moving forward total banking system loan growth to date stands at rm117tril some analysts are however maintaining their loan growth projections this year  on a yeartodate annualised basis the banking systems outstanding loans growth was relatively flattish at 98 in august property loans remained the key driver where loans for the purchase of residential and nonresidential properties accounted for 56 of credit growth  this is followed by working capital and hire purchase loans contributing 152 and 11 of credit growth respectively lending indicators for august gained momentum yearonyear but fell on a monthonmonth basis   loan applications approvals and disbursements dropped by 99 81 and 24 monthonmonth to rm675bil july 2013 rm75bil rm335bil july 2013 rm365bil and rm801bil july 2013 rm821bil respectively


petaling jaya although the latest measures introduced by bank negara to rein in household debt would ensure a sound and sustainable household sector more is needed to prevent debt from reaching alarming levels said economists the household debt in malaysia which stands at about 83 of gross domestic product gdp is higher than many other countries in the region like the philippines indonesia singapore hong kong and japan if not prevented it could put a damper on the countrys 56 projected gdp growth this year ram holdings bhd group chief economist dr yeah kim leng said he believes the latest measures in combination with the earlier ones would have the cumulative albeit modest and gradual effect of crimping household debt  the latest measures would help to moderate the increase in total household debt as the earlier responsible lending guidelines introduced last year have only had a marginal impact on slowing down the rise in total household debt to 130 in 2012 from 134 in 2011  certain measures therefore have to be in place in combination with the existing ones to ensure the soundness and sustainability of the household sector the loantovalue ltv currently at 70 for the third housing loan and debttoincome net of all other borrowing measures could be further tightened for instance the 70 ltv could be lowered or applied to the second or first loan while the debttoincome could be lowered to 30 instead of 50 of monthly net income he told starbiz  in addition he said the net income could be defined more stringently to include other obligations of the borrower to rein in excessive property price increases that have contributed to rising property loan demand the real property gains tax rpgt could be further raised to curb speculative activities he added  other complementary measures needed include efforts to boost housing supply and containing construction cost increases he said adding that more blunt monetary measures such as raising the overnight policy rate or banks reserve requirements could be applied if the macroprudential measures applied thus far prove inadequate to contain household debt buildup the latest measures by the central bank to curb household debt include imposing a maximum tenure of 10 years for the repayment of personal loans and a maximum of 35 years for property loans and prohibiting the offering of preapproved personal financing products apart from this key credit providers are required to observe prudent debt service ratios in their credit assessment to ensure households have sufficient buffers to protect them against rising costs and unexpected adverse events the banks new measures also bring some of the lending practices at development financial institutions and nonbank financial institutions nbfis in line with those of conventional banks malaysian rating corporation bhd chief economist nor zahidi alias said more measures were needed to curb speculative activities implementing more measures to curb speculative activities in the property market can be positive this may include a lower ltv ratio for third property purchases higher stamp duty for property transactions and higher rpgt all these would help curb speculative activities he noted he said the latest measures by the central bank were positive in view of the serious level of household debt in the country the growth in personal financing has been robust in the past several years especially among nbfis he said adding that nbfis had collectively extended 57 of personal financing credit to households in 2012  zahidi said no doubt they are secured by automatic salary deductions for civil servants but the rapid surge in the amount of personal financing extended to households would pose some sort of risk to the economy through a possible decline in private consumption in the event of a serious downturn he foresees the household debt level beginning to stabilise next year should the new measures begin to take effect in controlling the growth in personal financing he said no doubt there was still a sizeable amount of loans related to mortgages but at least they were backed by underlying assets in a recent report bank negara governor tan sri dr zeti akhtar aziz noted that housing loans formed the bulk of malaysias household debt at 445 while 168 were personal loans


this is turning out to be generally an interesting time for malaysia building society bhd mbsb following the enforcement of financial services act 2013 fsa the nonbank financial provider next course of action will be closelywatched by investors and the industry   under the previous banking and financial institution act 1989 bafia mbsb is defined as a scheduled institution the status of an exempt finance company was granted to mbsb on march 1 1972 by the finance ministry and the status has remained since and is thus not bounded by any financial regulators in malaysia the status allows mbsb to undertake a financing business in the absence of a banking license   analysts say under the new legislation the finance ministry could designate financial intermediaries not under the supervision of central bank as a prescribed financial institution if such intermediaries are deemed to pose a risk to financial stability thus it will be interesting to see what will this mean for mbsb   alliance research analyst cheah king yoong says under section 212 of the fsa bank negara is authorised to supervise entities previously not under its charge   bank negara is authorised to supervise financial entities previously not under the supervision of the central bank but are now deemed to pose a systemic risk to the overall financial stability by the finance ministry this could impact the relatively large nonbanking entities currently not under supervision of bank negara such as mbsb he says   in addition maybank investment bank research analyst desmond chng says technically this could bring mbsb and the development financial institutions dfis under bnms purview but only if they pose a risk to financial stability  assuming mbsb is designated as a prescribed financial institution the nearterm impact could be negative from a reclassification of its nonperforming loan npl on a 3month rather than 6month basis which could raise npl levels and the need to shore up capital  secondly mbsb would likely have to raise equity capital much sooner than expected to bolster its capital base its tier 1 capital ratio was 66 endsep 2012 chng says      click on image for larger view   reclassifying mbsbs npls from six months to a threemonth basis is necessary to enable mbsb to evaluate the progress of its transformation visàvis the commercial banks under bank negaras purview  a local bankbacked analyst says that presently it remains status quo for mbsb unless it is deemed as posing a systemic risk to the financial stability mbsb is not governed under the now repealed bafia and its books are not audited the caveat for mbsb to come under the central banks charge is if it is deemed risky  he adds that the fsa opens up an opportunity for bank negara to look at its books as they dont have any restriction from doing that for now   analysts say the concern on mbsb is its burgeoning portfolio of personal loans to civil servants   started in 1950 as the federal and colonial building society ltd the loan portfolio for mbsb has grown significantly from just providing mortgages its biggest earnings contributor now is made up of personal loans to civil servants and it has since expanded into financing retail businesses corporate outfits wholesale banking and treasury products  as at dec 31 2012 fy12 mbsbs total loans rose to rm243bil with the bulk of it coming from personal loans   mbsbs personal financingi pfi has grown tremendously in the past five years in 2009 its pfi accounted for just about 116 of its gross loans and this has swelled to 663 in 2012 concurrently its mortgage which formed the bulk of its gross loans in 2009 accounting for 479 has reduced to 185 in the first quarter its auto loans are gaining traction especially since the company tied up with the naza group  in addition mbsb has also been reducing its total net npl ratios over the years to 45 in fy12 from a high of 1954 in 2009 mbsbs deposit growth has also registered a significant growth in fy12 its deposit rose to rm215bil in fy12 from rm76bil in fy09   in the first quarter ended march 31 2013 mbsb saw its net loans and financing grew more than 50 to rm266bil from rm176bil in the first quarter in 2012 it reported a net profit of rm16614mil or 1308 sen per share in the first quarter ended march 31 compared with rm7941mil or 653 sen per share a year ago underpinned by its islamic banking operations and lower impairment losses  mbsbs pretax profit surged 1146 to rm23711mil from rm11047mil while revenue rose 484 to rm56247mil from rm37888mil  for 2013 mbsb aims to bring its loantodeposit ratio down to 95 while a 20 target has been set for loan and deposit growth  nevertheless mbsb is already working towards complying with bank negara guidelines but is not in a hurry to get a banking licence from bank negara in march mbsb chief operating officer clifford anthony clement reportedly said mbsb is already revamping its internal structure to prepare to comply with the fsa   president and chief executive officer datuk ahmad zaini othman says mbsb must first practise and perform like a bank before its application can be approved by the central bank licence is something

finally the audit oversight board aob has imposed its first sanction on july 12 more than two years after it had been set up the board reprimanded alvin tee guan pian the senior partner of accounting firm uhy malaysiathe aob only provided a brief description of the breach failure to comply with the relevant requirements of the recognised auditing standards in malaysia ie the international standards on auditingtee was penalised because he was the engagement partner in the audit of a public interest entity pie for the financial year ended july 31 2010 it appears that the breach had to do with the way the audit was conductedapart from listed companies pies include banking and financial institutions including islamic banks and development financial institutions insurance companies and takaful operators and holders of capital market services licences such as securities and futures trading firms and fund management companiesthe aobs refusal to reveal more about why tee deserved a reprimand invites us to play the guessing game which of the many international standards on auditing applies in this case and in what way exactly did tee fail to comply with the auditing standard or standards why did this merit a sanctionit was uhy that threw some light on this matter through a press release it issued on july 16 in response to a starbiz report on the reprimandthe firms explanation is that there is a clash of opinions on whether it was right to believe that the pie was a going concern back when its 2010 accounts were auditedsaid the press release uhy elaborated that the particular pie was merely undergoing a recapitalisation exercise where the focus on uhys decision to concur with its clients going concern assumption has been an area that the aob differs in terms of its technical view of the matter uhy believes it has strong grounds to appeal the aob decision as the differing views are judgemental in naturea fundamental principle in the preparation of financial statements the going concern assumption simply means that the management of an organisation has no reason to believe that the organisations operations will come to a halt in the foreseeable futurewhen doing an audit the auditor has to decide whether the use of the going concern assumption is appropriatethe aob has not responded to the uhy statement although when speaking to starbiz earlier aob executive chairman nik mohamed hasyudeen yusoff took pains to point out that the reprimand didnt mean that the pies 2010 accounts didnt give a true and fair view of the pies financial position and performanceinstead he added the reprimand was because the auditor failed to do what was necessary in performing the auditbut what was it that wasnt done we wont know until the aob and uhy decide to say moremeanwhile its useful to look at the aobs annual reports for 2010 and 2011 which talk about issues concerning the going concern assumption that were uncovered when the board reviewed the audit work of some firmsin 2010 the aob highlighted several weaknesses in this area such as auditors not doing enough to assess the appropriateness of the going concern assumption although there were signs of going concern issues lack of evidence that the auditors had challenged key assumptions used by management to support the basis for going concern and a majority of auditors failing to perform an independent stress test or sensitivity analysisthe board then became specific in three instances there were disclosures in the financial statements or managements representation letter which point to significant doubt or dependence of a future event to support their ability to continue operating as going concern entities however the audit opinion did not reflect the substance of such disclosuresin another instance while an emphasis of matter opinion relating to going concern was issued the description of the facts supporting the opinion gave a different connotation as though there was no default in debt obligationssome of these issues observed in the 2010 inspections persisted the following year judging from the comments in the aobs annual report 2011the aob reiterates the need for assessing the fundamental assumptions of going concern made by management in the preparation of financial statements audit firms need to improve in this area as our inspection revealed that the performance of audit procedures is generally lacking said the board in the latest annual reportit is important to acknowledge that going concern considerations involve risks of key judgment area especially when the managements assessment may not be realisticclearly this is an area that calls for professional scepticism something that auditors are expected to exercise in spades in the course of their workthere is no easy way to determine how sceptical an auditor should be in assessing the appropriateness of the use of the going concern assumption but the aob reprimand last week suggests that an intimate knowledge of the international standards on auditing is always desirable executive editor errol oh was told that professional scepticism is in short supply but he doesnt believe it

petaling jaya the audit oversight board aob has flexed its regulatory muscles in a surprising way when it shortened the tenure of registration for three partners of two accounting firms from the usual one year to six months although by no means the harshest action that the board can take this reduction of the validity period of registration serves notice that the work of auditors of large companies is indeed under greater scrutiny than beforethis measure came after the boards inspection last year of the countrys six biggest audit firms  pricewaterhousecoopers kpmg ernst  young deloitte bdo and crowe horwath two of the three partners are from crowe horwath while the third is from ernst  young they were registered for six months instead of 12 because the aob found certain shortcomings while reviewing the audit jobs in which the trio were involved as engagement partnersan audit engagement partner is the person responsible for the performance of an audit and for the audit report issued after the work is donethe rationale for the shorter registration tenure for the three individual auditors is so that they will go through an earlier reevaluation than the rest to determine if there are improvements in the audits under their watchunder the section 31s of the securities commission act 1993 the period of registration with the aob or the renewal is for 12 months but the board has the discretion to specify otherwiseaob executive chairman nik mohd hasyudeen yusoff said the decision to halve the registration period for the auditors was based on its observations during the inspections of their firms last yearhe added we feel that we need to send a signal that the auditors must improve themselves we want the firms to be very serious about maintaining audit quality we shortened the registration period because we are timing the next inspections to happen before the respective sixmonth period is up we will look at their job performance and if they have improved we will put them back on the normal arrangementson why the aob focused on the partners instead of their firms he explained that the boards inspections showed that the firms had put in place the required process and controls the other part is when the individual auditors perform their work as engagement partners they take responsibility from our viewpoint and after deliberation at the board level this is the right measure to take in these particular situations based on the facts of these cases if we had felt that the issues were more of a systemic nature we would have looked at the firms he saidhe pointed out that shortcomings identified in the inspections related to noncompliance with some aspects of the international auditing standards in the performance of the relevant audits but these did not invalidate the audit opinions expressed on the financial statementscrowe horwath malaysia managing partner poon yew hoe said the firm had 20 partners the registration of all of them were renewed accordingly except for the two whose registration were renewed for six monthswe are not aware of any specific reasons for the sixmonth renewal and will be working closely with the aob to ensure all our partners remain registered with the board at all times as integrity remains one of our core values crowe horwath is committed to observing and adopting the highest level of auditing and ethical standards he addedin a statement issued to starbizweek ernst  young said it welcomed the findings and comments in the aobs inaugural annual report released on march 31 added the firm the aob has acknowledged that the audit firms inspected had put in place systems and procedures in line with global best practices however there are some specific areas for improvementhowever the firm declined to comment on the sixmonth renewal of its partners registration pending clarification from the aobthe aob commenced operations on april 1 last year and immediately began registering audit firms and individual auditors at the yearend 83 firms and 310 individual auditors were on the boards register of auditorsthe six firms covered in last years inspections were chosen because they collectively audited 73 of the public interest entities pies in malaysia while their listed clients accounted for 93 of the total market capitalisation of the companies on bursa malaysia pies include listed companies banking and financial institutions including islamic banks and development financial institutions insurance companies and takaful operators and holders of capital market services licences such as securities and futures trading firms and fund management companiesthis year the aob plans to inspect the six largest firms again plus 12 others

innovative in extreme cases their formation may lead to cartelisation to the detriment of consumershowever that tendency could be limited as banks compete heavily against each other an analyst points out while in the area of mortgage loans the rates are getting cheaper it is noted that rates for credit cards stay consistently high among all the banksanalysts caution against systemic risk if the largest banks merge to form banks that can be deemed too big to failin the us that threshold is 10 of loans however  in the malaysian context there is already a high concentration of assets in the

of maybank does not see these two trends  consolidation and expansion  as contradictorythe need for the banking industry to expand will be there as long as consumer and business demand grow to expand the economy and in turn it is the banking sector that also drives the economy he saysas malaysia becomes a developed economy it is the larger banks with their economies of scale and scope that will have the ability to provide a wider range of products and services at a lower costfor this to happen the industry will have to go through a consolidation phase where banks will grow not just organically but through acquisition of smaller banks says wahidthe major issue is ensuring that the right banks are merged there must be a business fit that complements each other with as little duplication as possible reducing this duplication will take time given that retrenchments or relocation of employees could have regulatory restrictions as seen in the previous consolidation of 19992002 where banks were not allowed to retrench staff for two years following a mergerexperience has shown that banks can often see a decline in productivity upon a merger and in practice mergers can take two to three years before they become value accretive depending also on the valuation of the acquisitionin the interim if investors see greater value elsewhere the resulting depressed share price could have negative implications for example in raising capital says an analystanother issue for smaller banks in attracting foreign banks to become a strategic partner is that the limit on foreign shareholding could be a hindrance although this could be resolved on a case by case basis as indicated by bank negarajegarasasingam of marc cautions against small malaysian banks from expanding into regional markets which are generally risky and complex to managein consolidation exercises heavy competition among potential acquirers may at times result in a substandard due diligence exercise arising from the eagerness to close the deal ahead of competitors he saysany merger or acquisition should not merely be driven by attractive pricing such deals should also be evaluated in terms of the potential value proposition and the effort required for extracting results out of the deal he adds   future directionwith so many measures taken to boost islamic banking repositioning the

a lot is riding on the sturdiness of the audit oversight board frameworkwhose fault is it if the quality and reliability of audited financial statements in malaysia suffer because the audit fees dont correspond to the amount and nature of work required to do a good job this mismatch is a common complaint among the auditors we often hear them lamenting that the fees in malaysia are on the low side for an example of this read our up close  personal interview with kpmg malaysia managing partner mohamed raslan abdul rahman on page 6the maiden annual report of the audit oversight board aob issued on thursday has amplified the issue when highlighting the key findings from its inspections of the six largest audit firms in the country the board points out that auditors need to price their services at levels that will ensure that they can comply with the requirements of auditing and ethical standards the worry here is that firms may decide on the resources to be deployed for audit engagements based on the fees they will earn rather than on the risks that need to be addressed when auditing the accountsin its annual report the aob relays the grouse of audit firms that due to the relatively low audit fees in malaysia it is a big challenge for them to secure adequate resources considering that the aob was set up to assist the securities commission in regulating auditors of public interest entities pies its telling that the board saw this matter as worthy of a mention but does this mean that the authorities agree that the auditors are not being paid enough for their servicesif youre bent on getting an unambiguous answer to that good luck to you the board will only go as far as to emphasise that the fees should be properly tied to the audit work that ought to be done it says in the annual report the aob is mindful that the global economy is still in a recovery stage this will continue to place pressure on pies to contain their operating costs including audit fees nevertheless the aob expects auditors to price their fees to commensurate with the risks undertaken so as not to compromise on audit qualitypies include listed companies banking and financial institutions including islamic banks and development financial institutions insurance companies and takaful operators and holders of capital market services licences such as securities and futures trading firms and fund management companieswhen fielding questions from reporters after releasing the report aob executive chairman mohamed nik hasyudeen yusoff stopped short of endorsing the view that companies in malaysia should get used to the idea of paying higher audit fees he said the board would not tell the firms what to charge clients and would leave this to the market forces to decide instead he urged companies to look at audit fees as an investment rather than as a cost because the work of auditors supports the enhancement of a companys valueto help audit firms in determining fees the malaysian institute of accountants have something called a guide to charging for professional assurance services it says fee arrangement is a matter for commercial negotiation by practitioners the institute does not prescribe the mandatory basis for calculating fees nor does it ordinarily investigate complaints relating solely to the quantum of fees chargedthe level of fee is to be mutually agreed between the auditor and his client which largely depends upon the skill and knowledge required level of training and experience of the staff involved the time necessarily occupied and the degree of responsibility and urgency of work involvedhowever this rpg recommended practice guide is useful as a benchmark to establish the reasonable level of remuneration commensurate with the provision of professional services of an acceptable and recognised standard in the absence of other more sophisticated billing methodologythe problem is not many firms make full use of the rpg hence we continue to hear the auditors grumbling about the fees perhaps their best hope is that the aob framework will bring about desirable changesthe strategy here is that the aob inspections will compel the firms to improve their compliance with the standards and consequently the firms will turn to their clients and say look well get into trouble with the regulators if our audit work falls short of the requirements of the standards we wont cut corners and we wont reduce the scope of the work our fees have to be rightsized if you dont want to pay that much find auditors who are willing to risk being slapped with sanctions by the aobof course such a transition in mindset will take time meanwhile lets see how the aob handles the errant firms that has no qualms about bending the rules to fit the fees the annual report has this to say it has been a known area of concern that the provision of nonaudit services by audit firms to their listed audit clients may result in auditors lowballing their audit fees to gain more consulting jobs at clients and this may compromise independence the aob will be reviewing the safeguards in place to understand how the threats are mitigated again who should we blame for lowquality audits deputy executive editor errol oh believes that many people dont understand what is it that auditors really do


kuala lumpur the audit oversight board aob has pinpointed a number of shortcomings after inspecting the countrys six largest audit firms last year this raises the possibility of the board finding more areas of concern when it widens its inspection coverage to include smaller firms this yearaob executive chairman nik mohd hasyudeen yusoff said the board was targeting to inspect 18 audit firms this year including midtier and small firms we will have a better picture of where everybody is in the financial reporting ecosystem he told reporters after the release of the aobs maiden annual report yesterdayhe described the inspections and the resulting remediation as the most important part of the boards work this is where we try to influence the quality of audit when we understand where the firms are lacking and where they can improve he saidlast year the aob used a riskbased approach to select the six firms for inspection these firms are the big four pricewaterhousecoopers kpmg ernst  young and deloitte and two others with more than 10 partners the board did not name the latter but according to its register of auditors bdo and crowe horwath are the only firms apart from the big four that have more than 10 partnersnik mohd hasyudeen said these firms collectively audited 73 of the public interest entities pies in malaysia while their listed clients accounted for 93 of the total market capitalisation of the companies on bursa malaysia pies include listed companies banking and financial institutions including islamic banks and development financial institutions insurance companies and takaful operators and holders of capital market services licences such as securities and futures trading firms and fund management companiessaid nik mohd hasyudeen we have decided that the six firms will continue be inspected annually because of the impact of their work whereas the others will each be inspected every three years but that depends on what we find during the inspections because we may have to conduct followup inspectionsin his message in the annual report he wrote while we determined that the audit firms inspected had put in place systems and processes in line with global best practices some specific areas for improvements were identified the aob will follow up on the remediation efforts of the audit firms to ensure substantive changes are effected to enhance audit qualitythe report said the inspections had identified a number of shortcomings that needed to be addressed by the firms particularly in the area of audit documentation and evidence for significant judgement areasif a firm doesnt document its work there is no basis for us to confirm that the firm has performed its function one of the principles that we have adopted in our inspections is that if you fail to document we will consider that you have not done the audit procedure this is a very strong position that we have taken added nik mohd hasyudeensaid the aob in the annual report other than instances where there was insufficient documentation for the audit evidence obtained there were instances where the necessary audit procedures and evidence were clearly not performed or obtained it is pertinent to recognise that without sufficient evidence and analysis the auditor may not have a basis to support their opinionthe board also called on the auditors to be more robust and to apply professional scepticism in challenging management assumptions and estimates particularly in areas that require significant professional judgement such as in determining fair value asset impairment and going concernhe said these were highly subjective areas and pointed out that the value of the audit work came from the auditors exercising professional scepticism to objectively and independently arrive at audit opinionsanother key observation by the aob following last years inspections was the need for audit firms to price their services at levels that commensurated with the risks undertaken so as not to compromise on audit qualitythe annual report also highlighted that human resource was an important factor in ensuring high quality audit including ensuring appropriate workload of partners and other members of the audit team as well as attracting new talent through a conducive work environmentnik mohd hasyudeen said the board had yet to determine if the issues uncovered in last years inspection would lead to inquiries and possible sanctions he explained our main focus is to work with the firms on remediation that is very critical if we have identified areas for improvement we need to get that resolved immediately rather than to prolong the situation given that we just completed the inspections in december we are still looking at a number of issues if we were to impose sanctions we will be transparent


the buildup of household debt has been a topic that has generated much discussion in recent months and yearsyes the numbers do show household debt as a percentage of gdp rising and at the end of last year it was 759 the worry is that it is the largest percentage rise in asia and the memory of the consequences of uncontrolled buildup has been displayed in south korea where the unravelling of its credit card debt sent the economy southwardworking in favour of the economy is that the debt buildup has been supported by household assets which is more than twice that of total household debtfull employment the high savings of malaysians and low nonperforming loans of household debt adds to the cushion for the regulator in assessing the overall situation with household debt and the potential systemic risk it posesin bank negara governors statement in the financial stability and payment systems report 2010 tan sri dr zeti akhtar aziz says that while household indebtedness has increased in the recent years it has continued to be supported by strong financial buffers at the aggregate levelincome growth the high savings rate and favourable employment conditions have contributed to supporting the debt servicing capacity of households she says in her statementto ensure that this does not become a source of financial instability a comprehensive series of policies were introduced during the course of the year these include prudential policies applied in the residential property sector new credit card measures and strengthened requirements for banks to adopt prudent and responsible lending practices this was reinforced by more intensive supervisory oversight of financial institutions with respect to the management of household lending portfolios she saysthe governor adds in her statement that more targeted financial education programmes as well as advisory and support arrangements have also served to promote responsible borrowing by households these preemptive and more holistic measures also aim to contribute towards further strengthening the resilience of the household sectorthe central bank uses the financial stability policy committee a forum that assess risks to financial stabilitythe financial stability policy committee also works with the monetary policy committee which sets the overnight policy rate in coming up with macroprudential responses for the economysome examples how those committees have worked together has been the recent steps taken to put some brakes in household debt and consumption creditthe central bank last year had imposed a maximum loantovalue ratio of 70 for people wanting to buy their third or more homeslatest data do indicate demand for housing loans is starting to cool banks are paying more attention to applications of borrowers to weed out speculative borrowing but the impact will only be known in the march data to see if the drop is seasonal like it is at the beginning of any yearthe next measure bank negara took was to raise the minimum income limit to rm24000 per annum for people to be eligible for a credit card it is also limiting the number of credit cards to two for people earning less than rm36000 a yearthe reason for worry for credit cards stemmed from the growing use of credit for transaction purposesbank negara says that despite a reduction in the number of cards owned by households following the imposition of a rm50 fee by the government on credit cards in 2010 outstanding credit card balances increased by 152 to rm308bil at the end of last year to account for 53 of household debts it further says that outstanding balances per credit card holder rose by 151 to rm9516 as at end2010the number of credit card holders with revolving balances excluding defaulters accounted for 479 of total credit card holders more than half of credit card holders with revolving balances were those earning an annual income of rm36000 and below it says in the reportmeanwhile the level of nonperforming loans npls ratio for credit cards issued by banks and nonbanks remained low at 17the next step bank negara is taking is to stresstest individual borrowers to gauge if they can afford a new loan once new guidelines are introduced in the third quarter of this yearthe new guidelines are designed to inculcate responsible lending practices by financial institutions when dealing with retail customers where borrowers will be subject to a suitability and affordability assessment and verification of incomethe reason for that is while there are education programmes to inform young borrowers about getting into debt and how to manage their finances clamps need to be also put in place because the last thing anyone wants is a homegrown subprime crisisin tackling the affordability angle one area where consumption credit in still left unchecked and unregulated is personal financing from development financial institutions dfis cooperatives and building societieswhile a large fraction of household borrowings is collateralised as 453 of such financing was for the purchase of residential properties personal financing has increased significantly in recent periodsbank negara says in 2010 outstanding personal financing grew by 175 to account for 146 of household debt 2006 96 dfis coops and building societies accounted for the bulk of this growth with almost 80 granted under salary deduction schemesgiven the salary deduction feature credit assessments by these institutions are mostly limited to a reliance on incomplete computations of debtservicing ratios which are applied for the purpose of qualifying for the salary deduction facility the central bank says the absence of robust credit and affordability assessments will result in households being more at risk of becoming overindebted while the risk of defaulting on financing obligations including those obtained from other banking institutions will be higher for borrowers who have overborrowedthe central bank says excluding the dfis personal financing exposures of commercial banks increased at a lower rate of 13 to account for 86 of banking system household loans sound underwriting standards have largely been maintained by banks in terms of financing limits tenures and pricing for these exposures

petaling jaya five accounting firms were the first to run into trouble with the audit oversight board aob because they had accepted appointments last year as auditors of public interest entities pies without first registering with the boardthree listed companies  britetech bhd cn asia corp bhd and mintye industries bhd  were among those that had engaged these firms when it was illegal for them to act as auditors of piesafter detecting these cases in its monitoring of the agms of pies the aob sent showcause letters to the five firms asking them to explain why they had failed to register with the board before agreeing to become auditors of the pies however because the regulatory framework for auditors was just introduced last april the firms have been spared stiff penalties and are allowed to audit the financial statements of piesaob executive chairman nik mohd hasyudeen yusoff said that the idea behind setting up the board was to ensure robust oversight of auditors as such it viewed any breach of law seriouslyhe added that the aob had dealt swiftly with the five firms and had sent a very strong signal that it would not tolerate such incidents in the futurehaving considered the firms explanations and considering that this is the first year that the new law is implemented we issued warning letters to them we also require them to do certain reporting to us on a periodical basis to make sure that they are in compliance with the law they are now registered these are issues that we faced at the early stage of implementing this new law he told starbizthe securities commission act 1993 was amended last year to provide for the establishment of the aob and for related matters among other things the new rules require that an auditor of a pie be registered with the aob pies include listed companies banking and financial institutions including islamic banks and development financial institutions insurance companies and takaful operators and holders of capital market services licences such as securities and futures trading firms and fund management companiesthe amendments came into effect on april fools day last year which was also the day the aob commenced operations this meant that auditors that were due to be reappointed in agms scheduled to be held in the first few days of april had to quickly register with the boardgiven that many of their audit clients are pies the larger firms were naturally among the earliest to be registered for example ernst  young ey and pricewaterhousecoopers pwc were registered on april 1 itself while kpmg got into the aob register of auditors on april 9mohd hasyudeen explained that the board could register ey and pwc on its first day because a lot of groundwork had been done earlier to ensure that the firms knew the criteria for registration and could thus submit applications with the necessary information and documentationhe said we approved the applications on april 1 because we were satisfied that they met the criteria we were able to make these decisions because we had made all the preparationsprior to april the securities commission had made available the registration handbooks and forms and had fielded enquiries about the registration processanother factor that figured in the aobs speedy approval of registration applications was the need to avoid disruptions in the pies appointment of auditorsagms had already been scheduled and we did not want to see companies having to postpone the meetings and incurring costs just because the auditors could not accept appointments after failing to register in timewe preempted all these issues to make sure there was a smooth transition and implementation we are in the confidencebuilding business news that companies have failed to appoint auditors may not be positive so we cautiously manage that process mohd hasyudeen saidfor the board there is an additional layer of assurance in the fact that a criterion for aob registration is that the auditors must already be approved by the finance ministry under section 8 of the companies act 1965 under the companies act the finance minister gives such an approval to a company auditor when satisfied that the applicant is of good character and competent to perform the duties of an auditor under this actmohd hasyudeen pointed out that the registration process is not the only time that the auditors are subject to the aobs scrutiny if the auditors are registered and subsequently we find that they have not been truthful to us  say they have submitted misleading information or have omitted important information  we will act against them thats why we conduct inspections of auditors he addedthe aob declined to provide details of the five accounting firms that have been given warnings however by comparing announcements on the bursa malaysia website with the boards register of auditors starbiz has found that three firms had been appointed auditors of listed companies before they had been registered with the aob see table on b1 another three were appointed on the same day their applications for registration were approvedon the status of the latter three mohd hasyudeen said we registered them because we were satisfied that they had fulfilled our requirements we take it that they were each registered on that particular date

this is the second in a threepart questionandanswer series provided by pricewaterhousecoopers for the star readers on various aspects of budget 2005 the final part will appear in starbiz tomorrow q the finance minister in presenting his 2005 budget speech spoke on establishing a fund for tax refund can you explain what is the effect   a when the government introduced assessment on the currentyear basis as well as the self assessment system sas there are companies which have made excess payments on their tax these companies are entitled to claim refund from the government  up to now there has been no change in the procedure of paying refund as tax collected under the income tax act goes into the consolidated fund and cannot be used to make refund   the inland revenue board irb has to obtain the necessary fund from the treasury if the treasury does not provide the fund the irb would not be in a position to make the refund   with the establishment of a fund for tax refund tax collected can be allocated into the fund as determined by the finance minister directly and the irb would be allowed to utilise the monies from the fund to make refund  this will certainly improve the governments delivery system as refunds will be made in a shorter period   q the finance minister has announced that there will be changes in claiming the industrial building allowance for purchase of a used industrial building my company intends to buy a used building to expand its activities can you advise me how the proposed change will impact my claim on the industrial building  a the proposed change is to overcome the difficulty faced by the taxpayer ie the acquirer of the used industrial building in computing the annual allowance ie industrial building allowance iba   based on the current law the acquirer of a used building can claim iba based on the tax residual value of the construction cost ie construction cost less allowances claimed to date the acquirer would have to obtain the information on the construction cost from the vendor the acquirer may have difficulty in obtaining the information   the proposed change in law is to simplify the claim for iba as the basis of the computation of iba will be calculated on the current purchase price notwithstanding that the disposer will be subject to the balancing allowance or balancing charge in your case say if the purchase price of the building is rm1mil the company will be entitled to claim initial allowance of 10 and annual allowance of 3 in the year of acquisition   q the recent budget proposed that interestinsuspense be deemed as specific provision for bad debts and allowed a full deduction in the computation of income tax does this apply to stockbroking companies  a section 34 of the income tax act 1967 ita governs the tax treatment of provision for doubtful debts the new section 34 subsection 3b of the income tax act 1967 defines a bank as a bank or finance company or a banking and finance company licensed or deemed to be licensed under the banking and financial institutions act 1989 or islamic banking act 1983 or an institution prescribed under the development financial institutions act 2002 stockbroking companies appear not to be covered by the above provision   q the government has increased the duty for cigarettes again this year  as a smoker can i know how much will the price of cigarettes be increased  a the 2005 budget has announced a change in the duty structure for cigarettes the changes in the rate of import duty and excise duty are as follows  old import duty rm200kg

lifestyle the increase in excise duty to be around 40 for imported as well as locally manufactured cigarettes the increase in the excise duty would also increase the amount of sales tax paid   the impact of the increase on the consumer would ultimately depend on how much of the increase will be passed down by the tobacco manufacturers and importers the higher costs will increase the incidence of cigarette smuggling and would have to be addressed by the authorities   q the abolishment of the import duty on semifinished components for the woodbased industry would benefit the construction industry would this benefit be passed on to the property buyers  a although construction costs are expected to be reduced in the case where imported components are used the benefit may be minimal it would be up to the developers to determine how much of the reduction if any to be passed to the property buyers   q it was anticipated that budget 2005 will be a caring budget  how will budget 2005 benefit the man in the street  a the proposals that will benefit individual taxpayers at large include the following which will come into effect beginning in year of assessment 2005  ·the relief for

amid the interest in glc revamps it is easy to forget those that are not listed undercapitalised and burdened by bad loans bank industri  teknologi malaysia needs rejuvenation the process has already begun says othman mohd rijal amid the expectation that a successful revamp of governmentlinked companiesglcs will boost the stock marketit is easy to forget that not all ofthese companies are listed for thatmatter some of them will never getto bursa malaysia simply becausemaking profits is not their raisondêtre however even for these companies there is no escaping the mounting pressure to perform better bank industri  teknologi malaysia bhd knows all about this it celebrated its 25th anniversary last month but this year is meaningful not just because of the silverjubilee undercapitalised and burdened by the highrisk lending it is called upon to provide bank industri is reshaping itself the restructuring is expected to be completed by the yearend the idea is to become stronger in dealing with changes in the financial services business and in the strategic sectors that the bank focuses on over the years the banks basic role has been the same – to give medium to longterm financing to strategic capitalintensive industries what have changed significantly are the nature of these industries and the ability of the domestic capital market to finance their businesses bank industri chairman tan sri othman mohd rijal says the bank must reposition itself to continue to be effective in its role as a development financial institution dfi thatsupports these strategic sectors he points out that the bank has to keep up with rapid advances in hightechnology industries so that it can continue to offer financialproducts that meet the demand of these industries in addition dfis are perhaps no longer the no1 option when a highrisk business needs financing venture capital and debt securities have become reliable alternatives for bank industri restructuring is a necessary response says chairman tan sri othman mohd rijal we have to repair and clean our balance sheet and address capitaladequacy issues of course we next have to improve the banks organisational structure processes and operations the basis of the exercise is an ongoing review done jointly with professional service firm kpmg and rating agency malaysia bhd ram a development that was instrumental in pushing the bank towards some serious selfexamination was the enactment of the development financial institutions act which took effect in february 2002 following this the bank and two main subsidiaries exportimport bank of malaysia bhd exim bank and malaysia export creditinsurance bhd mecib came under bank negaras supervision along with that came the inevitable comparison with other players in the banking sector at the same time the governments push to reform glcs including the introduction of kpis key performance indicators addsimpetus to bank industris restructuring efforts we welcome this initiative because it brings the management and direction of the business in line with what is stipulated in the act which essentially emphasises goodmanagement prudential risk management and of course capital adequacy othman explains the dfi difference when stacked up against say the countrys commercial banks bank industri looks very much like a poor cousin the latters riskweighted capital ratio rwcr is 29 a negative ratio means that the capital base is insufficient to cover the assets including loans and its net nonperforming loans npl ratio as at june was 135 according to bank negaras july statistics the commercial bankss rwcr and net npl ratio stood at 142 and 58 the overall banking system had a rwcr of 139 and anet npl ratio of 62 however because bank industri is a dfi there is room to argue that it and commercial banks do not even belong to the same family in a way we are a slightly different creature says othman in a few ways actually to begin with the bank was set up in 1979 to fill a gap in the financial system back then commercial banks were reluctant – and understandably still are – to take on the high risk thatcomes with lending to certain businesses in the maritime and manufacturing industries but these industries were deemed important to the nations development goals and thus dfis like bank industri were required tofinance such businesses naturally that has led to a loan portfolio that has a disproportionate amount of assets of lesser quality says othman if we were to apply prudence in the same way it is applied among commercial banks we wouldnt be lending anything another key difference is that bank industri was left out in the restructuring of the banking sector in the wake of the asian financial crisis for example it did notreceive capital injection from danamodal nasional bhd but it is clear that there is a need to address the banks weak rwcr indeed the bank has sought fresh capital from the government – minister of finance inc owns bank industri – and at one time had apparently fancied its chances of getting a positive response in a rating review published last march ram says it had been given to understand that the government had agreed to restore the rwcr toat least 8 according to the rating agency that would need a capital injection of about rm800mil the governments plan to recapitalise the bank is viewed positively by ram although we believe that it may take some time before the actual capital injection takes placesays the report it will be a long wait bank industri is now resigned to making do without recapitalisation by the government othman says the capital injection is not likely to happen because the government is now intent on balancing the budget i think we have to figure out ways how to repair the banks capital structure ourselves floating to the top in that respect it helps that bank industri has some useful investments on its books last december for example it unlocked substantial value when malaysian bulk carriers bhd a joint venture with the kuokgroup was floated on bursa malaysias main board through subsidiary global maritime ventures bhd gmv bank industri still holds over 20 in the shipping company its alreadylisted and we will harvest the proceeds from there says othman in addition the bank is banking on gaining from the possible flotation of another shipping business according to gmvs 2003 annual report it operated 12 vessels injoint venture with wawasan shipping sdn bhd a unit of the imc group which is controlled by shipping magnate tan sri frank tsao the listing proposal is still in the planning stages but bank industri hopes to reap almost rm1bil in cash flow when it eventually disposes of its shares in the two shipping companies that should bring us to a positive rwcr of 14 to 18 depending on how we package the deals thats way above the minimum banknegara requirement of 8 othman says we consider ourselves very lucky because we have made very good investments that are maturing at the right time but he concedesthat the bank cannot depend on lady luck to bail it out the next time he says because of the kind of lending it does and the portfolio it carries it may well be back to square one in a matter of a few years he adds that the bank shouldbe compensated by other measures if a capital injection is not forthcoming the rwcr formula is a source of contention the banks group managing director datuk md noor yusoff says the formula requires thebanks investment in subsidiaries to be taken out of the banks capital base he argues we have to create so many subsidiaries given our small capital we have to borrow from the market to increase it the ratio is negative but we still continue our operations like normal and theinvestments in the subsidiaries are still good investments othman takes a somewhat different approach he views it as a positive that bank industri is included in the authorities moves to strengthen the countrys banking systemand culture at the same time he feels that bank industris responsibility for supporting highrisk ventures has to be taken into account the standards as applied by bank negara relates to the business of lending and finance you cant use a different measurement a measurement is a measurement thats it youve got to accept that but when the subject matter doesnt really fit into the framework of standards you have to look into what can be done to remedythat at policy and structural levelswhen asked if the bank has figured out the remedial measures othman says this is being done as part of
