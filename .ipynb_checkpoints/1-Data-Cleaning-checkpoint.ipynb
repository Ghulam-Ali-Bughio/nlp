      "<p>(Reuters) - When Yahaira Caraballo opened her nail salon in the Bronx, New York nearly seven years ago, it was a bare-bones shop with two nail technicians.</p><p>Earlier this year, she had six nail technicians, a full-time receptionist and a cleaning person, a renovated salon, and a following that included as many as 45 clients on a busy day.</p><p>Now Caraballo, 38, doesn't know how long it will be before her clients can once again sit side by side at her black shimmery nail bar for manicures, or on her salon's long studded bench to have pedicures.</p><p>\"We were pretty successful prior to this,\" said Caraballo. She's running the numbers to calculate if she can operate at half her usual capacity - the level she estimates will allow for enough space between customers to meet social distancing guidelines. \"It will have to work one way or the other, even if I have to cut some expenses or inventory.\" </p><p>She is still waiting for clearance from city and state officials to reopen her salon, which has been shuttered since late March when New York closed down all nonessential businesses to contain the spread of the coronavirus.</p><p>After that happens, there's the question of how many people will show up. Traffic had slowed to below half the usual pace even before the lockdown, as people became more nervous about becoming infected with COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.</p><p>Caraballo is one of millions of small U.S. business owners trying to adapt to survive the aftermath of the pandemic. Reuters will follow several over the next 12 months as they face crowd restrictions, reduced demand and public health concerns.  </p><p>Caraballo hopes to re-open in mid-June with plastic shields at the nail bar to create a barrier between technicians and clients. Customers will be welcome by appointment only and Caraballo plans to have the salon professionally cleaned at least twice a month. </p><p>She is not counting on getting much help. </p><p>Her landlord offered to create a rent payment plan once the salon reopens, because she is two months behind. But she hasn't been able to tap a loan from the federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), after applying twice. </p><p>Part of the $2.9 trillion economic relief package passed by Congress, PPP loans are meant to help small businesses keep employees on their staff. </p><p>Some minority business owners like Caraballo, who moved to New York from the Dominican Republic more than 20 years ago, have struggled to access the aid.</p><p>About four in ten beauty salons who applied for PPP loans did not receive them, the Professional Beauty Association, a trade group, found https://www.probeauty.org/docs/default-source/advocacy-documents/fica/pba_salonemployerpppsurvey_.pdf.</p><p>The federal government tried to reach more minority groups in a second round of PPP loans, by reserving $30 billion out of the $310 billion pool for banks with less than $10 billion in assets. The government also set aside $10 billion in funds for Community Development Financial Institutions, which are more likely to have relationships with minority-owned businesses and those in rural areas.</p><p>The first time Caraballo applied, through her accountant, she was told the funds were depleted. She has not heard back from her lender after a second application a month ago. </p><p>A loan of $15,000 to $25,000 would help her pay for rent, a deep cleaning, payroll and other debts. \"I don't even know if this is going to be over soon,\" she said. \"I feel helpless in a way.\"</p><p>Caraballo estimates her new monthly revenue may average $14,000, half what she could make before the crisis. After paying a 60% sales commission to her nail techs, nearly $3,000 a month for rent and about $2,500 for utilities and other costs, it will be tough to break even. </p><p>\"Hopefully it will get better,\" she said. \"We can only be optimistic.\" </p><p> (Reporting by Jonnelle Marte; Editing by Heather Timmons and Diane Craft)</p>\r\n",

      "<p>KUALA LUMPUR: Bank Negara Malaysia has reaffirmed its commitment to ensure sufficient ringgit liquidity in the onshore market.</p> <p>The central bank said on Friday its recent measures, particularly the reverse repo operations, Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR) adjustments, Principal Dealer facilities and the purchase of government bonds, have ensured sufficient ringgit and bond market liquidity.</p> <p>The central bank also noted that the recent pick up in interbank repo market activities have allowed banks to better manage liquidity.</p> <p>\"Financial Markets Association Malaysia will continue to work with insurance and asset management associations, corporates and other financial entities to increase the operational readiness on liquidity management, including ensuring that Global Master Repurchase Agreements (GMRA) are in place among market participants,\" Bank Negara said.</p> <p>It said three banks will spearhead initiatives to encourage participation in Sell and Buy Back Agreements among Islamic market players.</p> <p>Bank Negara said during its Financial Markets Committee meeting on April 9,2020, the committee also discussed efforts to boost the number of participants in the repo market, including active participation from Development Financial Institutions (DFIs).</p> <p>Meanwhile, on US dollar liquidity in the onshore market, BNM said it has access to the United States (US) Federal Reserve’s foreign and international monetary authorities (FIMA repo facility), which can be used to channel US dollar liquidity into the onshore market and alleviate US dollar funding needs as and when necessary.</p> <p>\"The committee noted that onshore US dollar liquidity conditions remained manageable and had improved over the past weeks following a period of heightened global risk aversion.</p> <p>\"However, it also acknowledged that financial markets globally continue to be susceptible to shifts in investor sentiment and thus, US dollar liquidity remains a key factor to be closely monitored,\" said the central bank.</p> <p>On challenges ahead, Bank Negara reiterated its commitment to provide sufficient liquidity to the wholesale interbank market to ensure uninterrupted financial intermediation, which will support households and viable businesses through the current COVID-19 crisis.</p> <p>It will also continue to engage market participants to pre-emptively identify and manage such risks.</p> <p>\"On fiscal policy, the government’s fiscal stimulus measures have demonstrated its commitment to support economic growth.</p> <p>\"The government remains committed to fiscal discipline and expects to resume fiscal consolidation efforts once economic conditions stabilise,\" it said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its implication on financial markets, BNM said the committee acknowledged that the global economy will be in recession in 2020, but expects a strong recovery in 2021.</p> <p>It had acknowledged the role of financial markets in providing liquidity and facilitating corporate funding requirements in supporting economic activities, against the backdrop of a weak growth.</p> <p>Financial institutions also play an important role to identify risks pre-emptively and conduct financial intermediation activities efficiently, the central bank said.</p> <p>\"The meeting discussed how rating actions could lead to knee-jerk reactions and increase volatility in financial markets, despite the global nature of this pandemic and the importance of fiscal spending to avoid long-term damage to the economy.</p> <p>\"Thus, it is important to put the one-off and transitory fiscal stimulus spending into this broader context in assessing potential ratings actions,\" it added. - Bernama</p> <p> </p>\r\n",

      "<p>WHEN Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin announced his stimulus package, it appeared, at first glance, a commendable, even an impressive, feat by his government to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, two key points merit assessment of the Perikatan Nasional government’s response to this crisis.</p> <p>First, when Muhyiddin addressed the nation, remarkably enough, he began by admitting that his “government may not be the government you voted for”.</p> <p>This was an astonishing admission by the Prime Minister, that he was aware many Malaysians question the legitimacy of his Perikatan government.</p> <p>The second point was his resolve to use government-linked companies (GLCs) to deal with the crisis. This, too, was an intriguing admission that he, as Prime Minister, had control of powerful business-related government-linked institutions that he could deploy during this crisis.</p> <p>Indeed, Finance Minister Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz would later draw reference to a “government ecosystem”. According to the Finance Minister, “direct fiscal injection” would come “from government agencies and related parties” in this ecosystem. Zafrul was not clear though of the source of borrowings by the government to fund this stimulus package.</p> <p>Muhyiddin’s admission of his control of major GLCs that have funds and other resources to support people and businesses in need was an indication of two core matters.</p> <p>First, Malaysia is a highly interventionist state with a well-developed institutional architecture to stimulate the economy and protect the interests of people in need.</p> <p>Second, a political-business nexus is in place in government, with the power that comes from such ties concentrated in the hands of the Prime Minister. This influential ecosystem, created in the 1970s to resolve social injustices, though now critiqued as a money-power nexus, has long remained in the shadows. In spite of repeated public demand for transparency about this “government ecosystem”, no prime minister has been willing to do so, even after the economic crises in 1997 and 2008.</p> <p>In this time of the Covid-19 crisis, there is a particular need to analyse how this powerful political-business nexus is being – or not being – employed in this stimulus package.</p> <p>What Muhyiddin and Zafrul referred to as GLCs, it must be stressed, includes much more than public-listed companies controlled by the government, such as the utilities-based Tenaga Nasional and Telecom and the financial-based Maybank, CIMB, RHB Bank and Bank Islam.</p> <p>This ecosystem includes pension and savings funds (such as</p> <p>EPF and PNB), statutory bodies (like Mara and Felda) and development financial institutions or DFIs (such</p> <p>as SME Bank, EXIM Bank</p> <p>and Agro Bank).</p> <p>The Prime Minister has stated, though with little clarity, how some of these GLCs will be employed.</p> <p>Tenaga Nasional, along with the government, according to Muhyiddin, will offer a discount on power consumption that will amount to RM530mil. Telecommunications firms will offer free Internet services with the government allocating RM600mil for this. Presumably, GLCs in these sectors will absorb these costs.</p> <p>As for the GLC banks, they will offer loan moratoriums, though this will not mean huge losses for them as these are merely deferred payments. EPF, though a pension fund, will allow for withdrawals to help people meet their expenses during this crisis.</p> <p>Most of these measures, as well as other aspects of the stimulus package, have already begun to draw much criticism.</p> <p>Why, for example, in this health-</p> <p>related crisis, have the GLC-based hospitals not been included in this stimulus package? GLC hospitals such as KPJ and Pantai as well as those controlled by Sime Darby were not mentioned, though Muhyiddin called on private hospitals to help the government. And, what of pharmaceuticals-based Pharmaniaga, as well as UEM-Edgenta which provide health-related services? Indeed, UEM-Edgenta has been criticised for not treating its workers well. During this pandemic, there is no need for these major health, financial and utilities-based GLCs to worry about registering huge profits.</p> <p>Other criticisms have emerged, particularly involving EPF.</p> <p>NGOs have admonished the government for calling on Malaysians, especially those in the B40, to use their meagre savings to share responsibility to reflate the economy. The SME Association has reacted badly to the stimulus package, claiming that 50% of such firms will wind down, with at least four million people losing their jobs. These SMEs constitute about 98% of the corporate sector.</p> <p>Since the Finance Minister has stated that the stimulus package will entail a reallocation of funds among government-linked agencies, other related issues arise.</p> <p>Why not reallocate funds in DFIs such as SME Bank, MIDF, Bank Pembangunan and EXIM Bank to small and micro firms which are in dire need to remain afloat?</p> <p>Why not employ Agro Bank and Bank Rakyat to help rural industries to ensure continued food production and supply? And what about statutory bodies such as Mara, Kesedar, Ketengah, Risda and Felcra, created to support small and rural industries?</p> <p>These institutions have, in fact, been long abused for patronage and distribution of concessions to obtain political support.</p> <p>Indeed, soon after the Perikatan government took power, it changed the board of directors of Mara which has oversight of a huge business base. There is a well-framed institutional architecture in this government ecosystem that has been used in the past to allow the government to intervene in the economy to achieve noble goals. These business-related government institutions can be employed to get help quickly to the ground during this crisis.</p> <p>There is, however, little indication in this stimulus package that the Prime Minister is using this government ecosystem effectively to deal with this pandemic.</p> <p>In fact, while trying to channel funds to people to increase consumption to sustain the economy, the government appears equally preoccupied with helping major GLCs remain profitable, keeping a powerful political-business nexus in place.After all, the Prime Minister himself admitted in his speech, he also has to deal with a political crisis.</p> <p>If ever there was a time to expose this powerful GLC world, and for politicians to dispense with using this power nexus to consolidate their position in government, it is now.</p> <p>Importantly too, since this shadow government’s ecosystem will be deployed to fuel the economy by an administration whose legitimacy is in question, it is imperative that parliament be convened to debate this stimulus package.</p> <p>Prof Terence Gomez specialises in political economy and is the dean of the Economics and Administration Faculty at Universiti Malaya.

Please contact the bank if you require a longer deferment period.</p> <p>Q: If I opt for the deferment, will my CCRIS records be adversely affected?</p> <p>No. However, interest/profit will continue to accrue on loan/financing repayments that are deferred and borrowers/customers will need to honour the deferred repayments in the future.</p> <p>Borrowers/customers are advised to contact their banking institutions to discuss on the options available to resume repayments after the deferment period.</p> <p>Q: Do I need to apply?</p> <p>No. All individual and SME loans/financing (excluding credit cards) that meet the criteria will automatically qualify for the deferment.</p> <p>Q: My loan/financing is in default, can I qualify? Can loans under rescheduling and restructuring (R&amp;R) programme be eligible for the deferment package?</p> <p>Loans/financing accounts that are already more than 90 days in arrears will not qualify for the deferment. Borrower/customers are advised to approach their banks to seek assistance.</p> <p>Loans/financing under R&amp;R programme is also eligible for the deferment subject to meeting the criteria.</p> <p>Q: How is the deferment package different from the other loan/financing moratoriums announced by banks recently?</p> <p>Banks and development financial institutions (DFIs) have been proactive in responding to the needs of their borrowers/customers with various rescheduling and restructuring packages offered to assist affected borrowers/customers.

How do I know if I have qualified?</p> <p>Banking institutions will provide individuals and SME borrowers/customers with adequate information that their loan/financing repayments have been deferred under this scheme.</p> <p>Such information may be provided through a general advisory issued to borrowers/customers through appropriate channels, and/or published on banking institutions’ websites.</p> <p>Q: I want to continue with my loan/financing repayments.

If business does not improve, I will soon be defaulting on my car and personal loans/financing? Do I qualify for the deferment package?</p> <p>Yes, provided that your loans/financing are not in arrears for more than 90 days as at April 1,2020.</p> <p>Q: Will I be charged additional interest on the repayment amount that is deferred by six months during the period?</p> <p>For conventional loans, interest will continue to be charged on the outstanding balance comprising both principal and interest portion (i.e. compounded) during the moratorium period.</p> <p>For Islamic financing, profit will continue to accrue on the outstanding principal amount. Such profit, however, will not be compounded in line with syariah principles.</p> <p>Banks are, however, not allowed to impose late penalty charges on the deferred amount.

How does being in the deferment package affect my interest payments after the 6-month period? Is there an increase in monthly payments, or longer tenure?</p> <p>Interest/profit will continue to accrue on loan/financing repayments that are deferred.

      "<p>PETALING JAYA: Bank Kerjasama Rakyat Malaysia Bhd (Bank Rakyat), which is known for its strength in the personal financing space, aims to expand its financing to the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and cooperatives.</p> <p>Almost 80% of its total financing portfolio is made up of personal financing, while the remaining 20% is for car and home loans as well as cooperatives financing.</p> <p>“Our aim is to grow more sustainably in the long run, and that includes diversifying our financing portfolio. We want to reduce personal financing to 70% of our total financing in the coming years as we grow our home, auto, SME and cooperative financing, ” newly appointed CEO Datuk Rosman Mohamed (pic)told StarBiz.</p> <p>Rosman took over the helm of the biggest Islamic cooperative in the country and the second-largest Islamic financial institution in terms of assets on Feb 1.</p> <p>Having built his career in Saudi Arabia, Rosman came on the board of the bank last April before becoming acting managing director in August.</p> <p>The lender is on a five-year strategic roadmap known as the “Bank Rakyat 2025” (BR25) programme to future-proof its business.</p> <p>Rosman explained that under BR25, the bank has identified five main blueprints, namely, digitalisation, great customer experience, human capital development, SMEs value creation centre, and sustainability and syariah leadership.</p> <p>“While digitalisation will be our main focus in the coming years, we have no plan to close down any of our 147 branches nationwide.</p> <p>“We are planning to transform about 30 of our branches into digital outlets, ” he said.</p> <p>He added that the bank has invested in a new banking system called Core Banking System that is targeted to be operational in June would include a mobile banking app.</p> <p>Bank Rakyat, which is under the Entrepreneur Development and Cooperatives Ministry is also targeting to play a bigger role in growing the cooperatives sector.</p> <p>The government is targeting the turnover of cooperatives to grow to RM60bil by 2030 from RM40.3bil in 2018.</p> <p>There are about 14,000 cooperatives in Malaysia, of which some 10,000 are active.</p> <p>Bank Rakyat was set up in 1954 with the mandate to raise the social and economic status of rural communities, provide opportunities for self-improvement and to build a better future for the underprivileged.</p> <p>Unlike other banks, Bank Rakyat is a cooperative bank and it is one of the country’s development financial institutions (DFIs).</p> <p>The difference between commercial banks and the DFIs is that the latter was set up by the government to carry specific mandate to develop and promote key sectors that are shunned by commercial banks.</p> <p>The other DFIs are Bank Pembangunan Malaysia Bhd, Small Medium Enterprise Development Bank Malaysia Bhd (SME Bank), Export-Import Bank of Malaysia Bhd (EXIM Bank), Bank Kerjasama Rakyat Malaysia Bhd, Bank Simpanan Nasional and Bank Pertanian Malaysia Bhd (Agrobank).</p> <p>Rosman highlighted that the Bank Rakyat’s financing to cooperatives and SMEs is currently small, which stood at RM2.5bil in 2018, in comparison to personal financing at RM54.88bil.</p> <p>He hoped the bank’s financing to cooperatives and SMEs would double to RM5bil by end-2025.</p> <p>“We are going to open centres that are not only to provide finances but also advice to SMEs.</p> <p>“We need to carve our niche in this sector and micro-financing is also something that we are looking into, ” Rosman said.</p> <p>He pointed out that Bank Rakyat’s personal financing has been doing well and the automatic salary deductions for the civil servant segment has kept the bank’s gross impaired financing (GIF) ratio at below 2%.</p> <p>Aside from expanding its lending portfolio, Bank Rakyat is also looking into ramping up its Current Account Savings Account (CASA) deposits.</p> <p>“Our CASA is one of the lowest in the banking industry and our plan is to approach local masjid to deposits with us aside from expanding our customers base, ” Rosman said.</p>\r\n",

Nasional Bhd have received the approval of Bank Negara to commence negotiations under the first phase of the government’s proposed merger involving the country’s development financial institutions (DFIs).</p> <p>BPMB in a statement said that negotiations between the two DFIs are expected to be completed within six months from Bank Negara’s approval.</p> <p>In Budget 2020, the government had proposed to merge four DFIs, namely, BPMB, Danajamin, Export-Import Bank of Malaysia Bhd (Exim Bank) and Small Medium Enterprise Development Bank Malaysia Bhd (SME Bank) to strengthen the development finance ecosystem via a two-phased restructuring plan to form a new financial institution.</p> <p>The first phase of the restructuring plan will involve the merger of BPMB with Danajamin, and the second phase to merge Exim Bank and SME Bank into the earlier merged entity.</p> <p>The smooth implementation of the restructuring plan would be overseen by a steering committee, led by the Finance Ministry.</p> <p>The steering committee consists of representatives from Credit Guarantee Corp Malaysia Bhd, Bank Negara and the four DFIs, as well as relevant stakeholder ministries including the Economic Affairs Ministry, the Entrepreneur Development Ministry and the International Trade and Industry Ministry.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a working committee, which would provide updates on the merger progress, would also support the steering committee in driving the implementation of the key integration aspects of the merger.</p> <p>Given the expected merger of the four DFIs, a banking analyst from Kenanga Research told StarBiz that the merger is expected to largely tap the financing for entrepreneurs as well as SMEs, driven by BPMB’s mandate to provide medium and long-term financing to the strategic sectors of the economy.</p> <p>“Right now, getting financing for the SME sector is tough, given the weak business sentiment.</p> <p>“Hence, conventional banks see the SME market and unsecured businesses as high risk to provide financing.</p> <p>“However, this merger would extend its financing to the SME business which is a big market as it faces difficulty in getting financing from conventional banks, ” he added.</p> <p>Overall, SME lending is seeing faster growth than total loan growth this year, according to MIDF Research senior analyst Imran Yassin.</p> <p>BPMB was incorporated in 1973 with the role of assisting entrepreneurs involved in SME industries through the provision of various financing facilities, training and advisory services, particularly to bumiputra entrepreneurs.Through its wholly owned subsidiary Pembangunan Leasing Corp Sdn Bhd (PLC), BPMB also provides financing to SME businesses including those involved in manufacturing, construction, supply, transportation, agriculture, hospitality and information technology.</p> <p>As of Dec 31,2018, BPMB had a combined asset value of RM24.7bil, reflecting that the group is well-positioned to meet the financing and business development needs of Malaysian businesses in the priority sectors.</p> <p>With the global economy slowing down, the analyst noted that merging Danajamin could be useful in the merger, as the bank would be able to capitalise the banking system should there be a rise in non-performing loans, moving forward.</p> <p>“This merger would strengthen the capital adequacy ratio, so it can continue to expand its lending to the SME sector and unsecured businesses, ” he added.</p> <p>The government’s proposal to merge four DFIs in the country could create an entity with a larger balance sheet that, in turn, could result in greater efficiencies and better cost controls.</p> <p>However, with these institutions serving different mandates, the operational side would be something that the government would need to address, according to industry players.</p> <p>Another likely issue that could crop up with the proposed merger is staffing, where there will bound to be duplications and overlaps in some operations, post-merger.</p> <p>Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said in his Budget 2020 presentation that DFIs played an important role as public institutions that support the nation’s development goals and serve the needs and requirements of the new economy.</p> <p>The possible merger of local DFIs in Malaysia’s already crowded and competitive

      "                A WEEK before the tabling of Budget 2020, this column highlighted that the budget will likely be a non-event as far as the market is concerned for the simple reason that the government’s finances are tight and it cannot simply afford the many wishes of the wide range of stakeholders.<br/><br/>While economic projections came within expectations, especially with respect to the budget deficit target of 3.2% and development expenditure of RM56bil, the projected revenue and expenditure were off by 4% each as they came in higher than expected.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the projected current balance of RM3.5bil was just slightly above the forecast RM3bil.<br/><br/>The Budget 2020 tabled last week is looking at economic growth of 4.8%, which is within the expected range of between 4.5% and 5%. It will be challenging, given the expected growth is to be mainly driven by private consumption, smaller contraction in public investment and but dragged by a drop in net exports as imports growth is expected to surpass exports next year. On the supply side, the significant contribution from the construction sector growth is not a surprise given some of the mega projects will likely kick off next year, while the services sector too is expected to be sustained at more than 6% growth.<br/><br/>Budget 2020 had several hits and misses. While it raised minimum wage to RM1,200, it is still short of the RM1,500 target.<br/><br/>At the same time the call to widen the tax revenue base was not fulfilled. The introduction of a new tax bracket of 30% for high income earners of above RM2mil a year is insufficient as it is only an incremental increase of two percentage points. The Finance Minister failed to introduce, or at least prepare Malaysians, to accept new taxes, especially Inheritance Tax and Capital Gains Tax.<br/><br/>The property market got a major boost with the lowering of the threshold price to RM600,000 from RM1mil for completed high rise condominiums and apartments that can be sold to foreign buyers beginning next year for a period of one year.<br/><br/>Hopefully, this would help developers sitting on these types of properties and to clear the existing overhang in the market. In addition, the Rent-To-Own scheme is good for first-time home buyers while the change in the base year for the purposes of Real Property Gains Tax (RPGT) to the year 2013 from 2000 is a welcome relief, although still not widely accepted. For administrative purposes, it is always better to calculate RPGT to the year the property is purchased and not any base year as valuation of a property at a given point of time in history is very subjective.<br/><br/>Budget 2020 was a positive surprise for those in the technology and in the electrical and electronics (E&amp;E) sector while the sin sectors were obviously sparred this time around, with the exception of a reduction in special draws for the number forecasting operators (NFO). The proposed merger of the four Development Financial Institutions (DFI) was another surprise and hopefully when that is done, the merged entity will be the next mega IPO to be listed on Bursa Malaysia.<br/><br/>For the environment as well as to promote green initiatives, the proposals made under the Budget are indeed welcome and could spur renewal energy further. With the target to achieve 20% of energy production by 2025, the introduction of a 70% income tax exemption of up to 10 years to companies undertaking solar leasing activities could spur higher demand among consumers.<br/><br/>But this could only happen if prices of solar panels became more attractive and the cost savings from the income tax reliefs are actually passed on to consumers. The problem among consumers is the upfront cost of putting up solar panels on their roofs as it can be as high as almost RM4,000 per KW peak or kWp.<br/><br/>Malaysia is also expected to see an accelerated pace of investments flowing into the country as the government’s move to establish a special channel via InvestKL to attract investments from China is seen positive. Despite a temporary truce to the US-China trade war over the weekend, nothing is certain just yet as to how the trade tariffs will pan out over the next few weeks. Placing Malaysia as a destination of choice for foreign direct investments is crucial as it signals our readiness in attracting long term investments which can create job opportunities and generate economic expansion. The setting up of the National Committee on Investment (NCI) is also a step in the right direction to spur and expedite inward investment activities.<br/><br/>The Budget 2020 was indeed a comprehensive document covering all Malaysians and indeed what better way than to focus on two main critical issues – cost of living and jobs.<br/><br/>The budget did not fail in this aspect as there were various incentives to address cost of living issues, including the newly introduced fuel subsidy mechanism, a free RM30 e-wallet deposit into accounts of entitled persons and last but not least, a 18% reduction for PLUS highway users effective New Year’s Day next year.<br/><br/>The toll issue has dragged on for far too long and with the tabling of the Budget 2020, we are now seeing some light at the end of the tunnel. When the Minister highlighted that the 18% reduction in toll translates to about RM1.13bil, it seems to suggest that the current shareholders of PLUS, the EPF and Khazanah, are likely to forgo any future dividends with the reduction.<br/><br/>With the commitment from the government that extension period for toll concessionaires is not going to be extended, it is likely the two or three proposals that are siting on the desk of the Minister or the Prime Minister will continue to collect dust.<br/><br/>Their proposals, while entailing even larger discounts than that proposed by the Minister, lack the commitment to end tolling in 2038. Hence, it is likely that their proposals are not going to see the light of day. Given the unspoken line, it is now likely that either Khazanah or the EPF to take the lead to buy out one or the other. Logically, as the ability to pay dividends to shareholders has now be diminished, it would make sense for Khazanah to acquire the 49% not already owned from EPF.<br/><br/>All in, the Budget 2020 was a comprehensive document towards the government’s new mantra towards Shared Prosperity Vision 2030. It was, for once, a budget for the people and inclusive as well as far reaching. Kudos to the Pakatan Harapan government. Well done!<br/><br/>Now, the tough and hard part – to implement the proposals as promised.<br/><br/><strong>The views expressed here are the writer’s own.</strong>\r\n",

      "<p>PETALING JAYA: Budget 2020 has just been tabled at the Dewan Rakyat by Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng.</p> <p>The Budget with its theme,\"Driving growth and equitable outcomes towards shared prosperity,\" is the second for Pakatan Harapan since the coalition won power.</p> <p>The following is the full text of Lim's speech to Parliament:</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>1. I beg to move the Bill intituled “An Act to apply a sum from the Consolidated Fund for the service of the year 2020 and to appropriate that sum for the service of that year” be read a second time.</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>2. Greetings, Salam Harapan and Salam Sayangi Malaysiaku, I bid to the Honourable Speaker, Honourable Members of Parliament of both the Government and the Opposition, and to all Malaysians. We are grateful that by God’s grace, Malaysia continues to be a peaceful, stable and prosperous nation.</p> <p>3. First and foremost, allow me to convey my undivided loyalty and my congratulations on the coronation of Kebawah Duli Yang Maha Mulia Seri Paduka Baginda Yang Dipertuan Agong Ke-16, Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri’ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah Ibni Almarhum Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Al-Musta’in Billah.</p> <p>4. I am humbled to stand before you to table the 2020 Budget. This is the second budget to be tabled under the Pakatan Harapan Government. Indeed, 2020 is a special year given that Wawasan 2020 was envisioned by our YAB Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir bin Mohamad nearly three decades ago in 1991, to celebrate Malaysia joining the ranks of developed nations. Vision 2020 would have succeeded, if not for the massive financial scandals, corruption and mismanagement of the previous Government.</p> <p>5. The first Pakatan Harapan Budget tabled in 2018 focused on fiscal consolidation and rationalisation, institutional reforms and people-centric policies to right the many wrongs of the previous administration. For this Budget, the theme is on “Driving Growth</p> <p>And Equitable Outcomes Towards Shared Prosperity”. The Government is committed to bringing stability to the Government’s finances and achieving the goal of Vision 2020 with a new growth trajectory under the foundation of “Shared Prosperity Vision 2030” as initiated by YAB Prime Minister, Tun Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad.</p> <p>ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND CHALLENGES</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>6. The global economy has been thrown into a state of uncertainty caused by the trade war between the United States and other nations, especially the People’s Republic of China. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised downwards the global economic growth forecast for the year 2019 from 3.9% in July 2018 to 3.2% in July 2019. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) has also reduced the forecast for world merchandise trade growth for 2019 from 2.6% in April 2019 to 1.2% in October 2019, the lowest since 2009.</p> <p>7. As a trading nation, Malaysia cannot avoid being affected by these external headwinds. However, with economic policies and reforms implemented by the Pakatan Harapan government, our economy will remain resilient. In the first half of 2019, GDP growth was 4.7%, with a growth rate of 4.9% in the 2nd quarter. Indeed, Malaysia is one of the few economies in the world that experienced faster growth in the second quarter compared to the previous quarter.</p> <p>8. The Government has also been very successful in taming inflation, with 0.2% recorded in the first half of 2019 compared to 1.0% and 3.7% for the whole of 2018 and 2017 respectively. Clearly the Goods and Services Tax (GST) implemented under the previous regime had contributed significantly to higher prices. By abolishing the GST of 6% in June 2018 and replacing it with the Sales and Services Tax (SST) regime in September 2018, the country’s inflation rate has been reduced to its lowest levels since 2007. For the full year of 2019, the inflation rate is expected to be at 0.9%. To respect the mandate given by the Rakyat in last year’s General Elections, the Government does not intend to bring back GST.</p> <p>9. Despite the global trade war, Malaysian exports only shrank marginally for the first 8 months of 2019 by 0.4% from a year ago. Malaysian exports are still expected to record positive growth for 2019. During the same period, Malaysia recorded RM92.5 billion worth of trade surplus, which is 28.7% larger than the RM71.9 billion recorded during the same period in 2018.</p> <p>10. This healthy trade balance will keep the country’s current account in surplus for the year. Overall, Malaysia’s balance of payments continues to be firmly positive, with the current account surplus for 2019 is expected at RM43.4 billion or 2.9% of Gross National Income (GNI). Meanwhile, as at 30 September 2019 our international reserves remain healthy at RM431.3 billion or USD103 billion, which is sufficient to finance 7.6 months of retained imports and is 1.1 times of our external short-term debts.</p> <p>11. The Malaysian financial system also remains sound and stable, despite a challenging global environment and high degree of volatility in the international financial markets throughout the year.</p> <p>2020 BUDGET THEME - DRIVING GROWTH AND EQUITABLE OUTCOMES TOWARDS SHARED PROSPERITY</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>12. We as Malaysians have a shared responsibility to rebuild the nation. Therefore, extensive consultations for Budget 2020 with stakeholders were undertaken. On top of the Budget Consultation hosted at the Ministry of Finance, we had a total of 12 Focus Group sessions held together with other Ministries and state governments all around the country involving over 2,500 people representing over 1,200 organisations.</p> <p>13. The four thrusts anchoring the 2020 Budget are:</p> <p>FIRST: Driving Economic Growth in the New Economy and</p> <p>Digital Era</p> <p>SECOND: Investing in Malaysians: Levelling Up Human Capital</p> <p>THIRD: Creating a United, Inclusive and Equitable Society</p> <p>FOURTH: Revitalisation of Public Institutions and Finances</p> <p>FIRST THRUST: DRIVING ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE NEW ECONOMY AND DIGITAL ERA</p> <p>Strategy 1: Making Malaysia the Preferred Destination for Investment</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>14. During YAB Tun Dr Mahathir’s first stint as the Prime Minister, he led Malaysia to its fastest decade of economic growth from 1988 to 1997 at an average annual GDP growth rate of 9.3%, marking the country’s ascent to be an Asian Economic Tiger. The influx of Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) had not only brought in new jobs with better wages, new businesses into the market and new economic opportunities, it also structurally upgraded Malaysia from being an agriculture-based domestic-centric economy into an industrialised export-oriented nation.</p> <p>15. However, at the turn of the century, Malaysia’s economic growth tapered off to an average of 5.1% since 2000. The premature deindustrialisation of the Malaysian economy resulted in the shift of our economy to one that is more reliant on labour intensive, lowskill, and low-cost structure. As a result, we remain trapped as a middle-income nation that has been hindered from becoming a truly developed economy based on productivity, innovation and shared prosperity.</p> <p>Trade War Opportunities</p> <p>16. The protracted trade war creates a unique opportunity for Malaysia to again be the preferred destination for high value-added Foreign Direct Investments (FDI). The shift in the global supply chain investments has witnessed approved FDI increasing by 47% to RM80.1 billion in 2018 from RM54.4 billion in 2017.</p> <p>17. For the first half of this year, approved FDI increased by 97% to RM49.5 billion from RM25.1 billion in the same period last year.</p> <p>The approved manufacturing FDI from the United States of America (US) was the highest at RM11.7 billion, followed by the People’s Republic of China at RM4.8 billion. As China is our largest trading partner, FDI from China should be comparable with the US. As such, a ‘Special Channel’ to attract investments from China shall be established under InvestKL.</p> <p>18. To overcome delays in approving foreign and domestic investments, we have established the National Committee on Investment (NCI), jointly chaired by the Minister of Finance and the Minister of International Trade and Industry. In our inaugural meeting on 28 August this year, three investments worth RM2.2 billion were approved.</p> <p>19. This year, the Government has embarked on a comprehensive review and revamp of the existing incentive framework, comprising the Promotion of Investments Act 1986, Special Incentive Package and incentives under the Income Tax Act 1967. This new framework is expected to be ready by 1 January 2021.</p> <p>20. The Government will make available up to RM1 billion worth of customised packaged investment incentives annually over 5 years, as part of the strategic push to attract targeted Fortune 500 companies and global unicorns in high technology, manufacturing, creative and new economic sectors. To qualify, these companies must invest at least RM5 billion each in Malaysia which will generate additional economic activities that will support our Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs), create 150,000 high quality jobs over the next 5 years and strengthen our manufacturing and service ecosystems.</p> <p>21. To transform Malaysia’s best and most promising businesses into the most competitive enterprises in global export markets, the Government will also make available up to RM1 billion in customised packaged investment incentives annually over 5 years.</p> <p>These incentives are strictly conditional upon these companies proving their ability to grow and export their products and services globally. We expect this measure to significantly strengthen our local supply chain ecosystem and create additional 100,000 high quality jobs for Malaysians over the next 5 years.</p> <p>22. In addition to expediting approval of investments, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) will give additional focus on post-approval investment monitoring and realisation. For this purpose, the Government will allocate RM10 million.</p> <p>23. The Government will also provide tax incentives to further promote high-value added activities in the Electrical and Electronics (E&amp;E) industry to transition into 5G digital economy and Industry</p> <p>4.0. These incentives include:</p> <p>First: income tax exemption up to 10 years to E&amp;E companies</p> <p>investing in selected knowledge-based services; and</p> <p>Second: special Investment Tax Allowance to encourage</p> <p>companies in E&amp;E sector that have exhausted the Reinvestment Allowance to further reinvest in Malaysia.</p> <p>24. In addition, to encourage automation and to increase company’s productivity, it is proposed:</p> <p>First: Accelerated Capital Allowance and automation equipment</p> <p>capital allowance for manufacturing sector on the first RM2 million and RM4 million incurred on qualifying capital expenditure is extended to the year of assessment 2023; and</p> <p>Second: The incentive is also be expanded to include services</p> <p>sector on the first RM2 million incurred on qualifying capital expenditure from the year of assessment 2020 to the year of assessment 2023.</p> <p>Improving Competitiveness</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>25. The Pakatan Harapan Government is committed to continuously improve the business climate in Malaysia. One of the key reforms to be implemented is to improve the ease of doing business in Malaysia by reducing the number of steps to register a business.</p> <p>26. It goes without saying that well-functioning ports and logistics system is crucial for a trading nation like ours. The World Economic Forum (WEF) 2019 Global Competitiveness Report ranks Malaysia’s sea transport infrastructures is one of the best in the world.</p> <p>27. Port Klang is currently the 12th busiest container port in the world and is expected to reach full capacity in the next five years. For the next phase of growth, the Government is undertaking an indepth feasibility study on the development of Pulau Carey. This is to make Port Klang as a regional maritime centre and cargo logistics hub combining manufacturing, distribution, cargo consolidation, bunkering and ship repairs.</p> <p>28. The Government will allocate RM50 million for the repair and maintenance of roads leading to Port Klang. The Ministry of Transport will commence feasibility studies on the Serendah-Port Klang Rail Bypass for cargo shipments and the Klang Logistics Corridor, a dedicated privatised highway connecting Northport and Westport for commercial vehicles, with both projects estimated to cost RM8.3 billion.</p> <p>29. To better facilitate trade movement through our ports, the Royal Malaysian Customs Department (RMCD) will introduce a deferred payment facility to expedite the clearance process of cross border transactions. This will reduce the time and cost for cross border trade significantly.</p> <p>30. Beyond our sea ports, the Government intends to strengthen trade with Thailand via our 100-acre logistics hub, Kota Perdana Special Border Economic Zone (SBEZ) at Bukit Kayu Hitam. Further to the development of a Truck Depot as announced in Budget 2019, the Government will allocate an additional RM50 million to stimulate public-private partnerships for the project. The Government would provide support for the construction of primary infrastructure, while the private sector will invest in critical business assets to catalyse potential domestic investment worth RM800 million which would provide job opportunities to more than 600 people.</p> <p>31. RM1.1 billion is allocated in 2020 to support projects for corridor development activities including:</p> <p>First: RM50 million for the development of Chuping Valley</p> <p>Industrial Area in Perlis by NCIA;</p> <p>Second: RM69.5 million for the Kuantan Port related projects by ECERDC;</p> <p>Third: RM42 million for the construction of Sungai Segget Centralised Sewerage Treatment Plant in Johor by IRDA;</p> <p>Fourth: RM55 million for infrastructure in the Samalaju</p> <p>Industrial Park in Sarawak by RECODA; and</p> <p>Fifth: RM20 million for the Sabah Agro-Industrial Precinct</p> <p>by SEDIA</p> <p>Strategy 2: Accelerating the Digital Economy</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>Building Digital Infrastructure</p> <p>32. YAB Prime Minister launched Malaysia into the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) era with the establishment of the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) in 1996. We are now entering the digital era. This Government is committed towards digital transformation.</p> <p>33. For the past year, the regulatory reforms implemented by the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) on the Mandatory Standard on Access Pricing (MSAP) has successfully lowered broadband prices by 49% and triggered a shift in consumer demand for faster internet connections. The World Bank has praised the Government for accelerating average broadband speed by 3 times in just one year.</p> <p>34. Now, the Government will create the necessary infrastructure to construct a Digital Malaysia by implementing the National Fiberisation &amp; Connectivity Plan (NFCP) over the next 5 years which will provide comprehensive coverage of high speed and quality digital connectivity nationwide including rural areas. The NFCP will adopt a public private partnership approach involving a total investment of RM21.6 billion. The Government, through MCMC, will finance at least half of the required investment with corresponding investments by the private sector telecommunications players via a matching grant mechanism.</p> <p>35. As part of NFCP, we will improve connectivity in remote areas of Malaysia, especially in Sabah and Sarawak, to ensure that no one is left behind in our digital drive. MCMC will allocate RM250 million to leverage on various technologies, including via satellite broadband connectivity.</p> <p>36. In addition, the Government will allocate RM210 million to accelerate the deployment of new digital infrastructure for public buildings particularly schools and also high impact areas such as industrial parks. Priority will be given to locations within states that are able to facilitate and expedite the implementation of the NFCP.</p> <p>Building Digital Applications</p> <p>37. The vigorous rollout of the NFCP will be key to bringing 5G technology and services to the Malaysian public. To seed technological developments by Malaysian companies to ride the global 5G wave, which is 100 times faster than 4G, the Government will introduce a 5G Ecosystem Development Grant worth RM50 million.</p> <p>38. In addition, an allocation of RM25 million will be given to set up a contestable matching grant fund to spur more pilot projects on digital applications such as drone delivery, autonomous vehicle, blockchain technology, and other products and services that leverage on our investments in fibre optics and 5G infrastructure.</p> <p>39. Digital content creates economic value. For instance, the global video gaming industry today has revenue upward of USD150 billion, higher than both the music and movie industries combined. Therefore, we will allocate RM20 million to Malaysian Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) to grow local champions in creating digital content, especially in e-Games, animation and digital arts.</p> <p>Building Digital Companies</p> <p>40. To build a Digital Malaysia, the private sector must come onboard. More Malaysian Small Medium Enterprise (SMEs) need to adopt digitalisation measures for their business operations, including electronic Point Of Sale systems (e-POS), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and electronic payroll system. The Government will provide a 50% matching grant of up to RM5,000 per company for the subscription of the above services. This matching grant will be worth RM500 million over 5 years, limited to the first 100,000 SMEs applying to upgrade their systems.</p> <p>41. The Government will also allocate RM550 million to provide Smart Automation matching grants to 1,000 manufacturing and 1,000 services companies to automate their business processes. This grant will be given on a matching basis up to RM2 million per company.</p> <p>42. The Government plans to build up to 14 one-stop Digital Enhancement Centres in all states to facilitate access to financing and capacity building of our businesses, especially SMEs in line with the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR4.0). A budget of RM70 million will be allocated to MDEC to set up these centres as an extension of the ‘100 Go Digital’ programme. To also promote knowledge sharing and education through digital enabled content, the Government proposes to establish 3 new digital libraries in Kedah, Perak and Johor.</p> <p>43. Programmes such as the Coach and Grow Programme (CGP) by Cradle Fund for high impact technology entrepreneurs involving 469 companies to date have generated RM2.3 billion in revenues, including RM300 million in exports. As part of the Government’s continued commitment to promote early stage innovations, the Government will provide RM20 million to Cradle Fund for the provision of training and grants to seed companies.</p> <p>Building Digital Malaysians</p> <p>44. To ensure gains arising from successful Digital Companies are shared with the Rakyat, the Government will introduce the concept of Digital Social Responsibility (DSR). DSR is the commitment by businesses, to contribute to digital economic development while improving the digital skills of the future workforce with initiatives such as technology scholarships, training and upskilling for digital skills for communities in need. Contributions towards DSR by the companies will be given tax deduction.</p> <p>45. We will continue providing funds of RM10 million to MDEC to train micro-digital entrepreneurs and technologists to leverage on e-Marketplaces and social media platforms to sell their products. 100 of these micro-digital entrepreneurs, a majority of whom are women and youth, were able to generate RM23 million in revenues over just 6 months, unleashing life changing experiences.</p> <p>46. The Pakatan Harapan government recognises the growing potential of eSports and will provide an increased allocation of RM20 million for 2020. We wish our Malaysian team the very best of luck to bring home many gold medals from the Southeast Asian Games in Manila in December 2019.</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>47. According to Bank Negara Malaysia’s Financial Sector Blueprint for 2011 to 2020, Malaysia stands to gain about 1% in cost savings to our GDP annually by switching fully to e-payments processes and becoming a cashless society. This is at a time where mobile payment transaction volume had increased twenty-fold to over 34 million transactions in 2018 from just below 2 million transactions in 2017. However, the overall adoption of e-wallet remains low at only 8%, based on a survey report by Nielsen in January this year.</p> <p>48. To significantly increase the number of Malaysians, participating merchants and SMEs to use e-wallets, the Government will offer a one-time RM30 digital stimulus to qualified Malaysians aged 18 and above with annual income less than RM100,000. All you need is to own an identity-verified e-wallet account with selected service providers. The one-time digital stimulus per person can be redeemed and used for a two-month period commencing 1 January 2020 and expiring on 29 February 2020. The Government will allocate up to RM450 million to Khazanah Nasional to implement this digital stimulus, which will benefit up to 15 million Malaysians.</p> <p>Strategy 3: Strengthening Access to Financing for Businesses</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>49. To better facilitate access to financing for SMEs in priority segments, the Government will implement enhancements to the Skim Jaminan Pinjaman Perniagaan (SJPP). For Bumiputera SMEs, export-oriented SMEs and SMEs investing in automation and digitalisation, the Government guarantee will be increased from 70% to 80% and in addition, will reduce the guarantee fee to only 0.75%. A new SJPP allocation of RM500 million in guarantee facility will also be launched, earmarked for women entrepreneurs.</p> <p>50. To further support our up and coming entrepreneurs, SME Bank will introduce two new funds where the Government will provide an annual interest subsidy of 2% to reduce borrowing costs as follows:</p> <p>First: a RM200 million fund specifically for women</p> <p>entrepreneurs, offering loans of up to RM1 million per SME; and</p> <p>Second: a RM300 million fund to support Bumiputera SMEs with</p> <p>the potential to become regional champions, with priority given to producers of halal products and manufacturers with high local content.</p> <p>51. The Government will allocate RM10 million to the Ministry of Entrepreneur Development to focus on advocacy and awareness for halal certification, halal product development and providing platforms for local players to tap on the USD3 trillion global halal market.</p> <p>52. For SMEs to remain competitive, they must continually expand their exports. The Pakatan Harapan Government will increase the ceiling per company for the Market Development Grant (MDG) initiative by Malaysia External Trade Development</p> <p>Corporation (MATRADE) from the current RM200,000 to RM300,000 yearly. At the same time, the ceiling for the participation in each export fair will also be revised upwards from</p> <p>RM15,000 to RM25,000. The Government will also allocate RM50 million to encourage SMEs to engage in more export promotion activities.</p> <p>53. In the era of fintech, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) is finalising the licensing framework for digital banks to be issued by year end for public consultation. The final framework will be issued by the first half of 2020 to invite applications.</p> <p>54. The Government will support and encourage new digital financial innovations such as Equity CrowdFunding (ECF) and</p> <p>Peer-to-Peer (P2P) platforms. Collectively, more than</p> <p>RM430 million was raised as at June 2019, benefitting more than 1,200 SMEs. Building on this early success, the government will further allocate an additional RM50 million to My Co-Investment Fund (MyCIF) under the Securities Commission Malaysia to leverage such platforms to help finance the underserved SMEs.</p> <p>55. To further encourage alternative sources of funding for startups companies and to attract more foreign investment to Malaysia, tax incentives given to venture capital and angel investors will be extended until the year 2023.</p> <p>56. To catalyse and promote financing to construction consortiums bidding for projects and concessions overseas, the Government will provide a RM1 billion 1:5 matching guarantee for dedicated private equity funds to invest in Malaysian consortiums.</p> <p>57. To support Bumiputera entrepreneurial development, grants amounting to RM445 million will be provided in terms of access to financing, provision of business premises and entrepreneur training. This includes:</p> <p>First: RM150 million for overall entrepreneurship development</p> <p>and upskilling by Perbadanan Usahawan Nasional Berhad (PUNB);</p> <p>Second: RM75 million by SME Corporation (SMECorp) for</p> <p>capacity building and export focus for Bumiputera SMEs,</p> <p>which includes enhancing marketing, packaging, and</p> <p>financial literacy;</p> <p>Third:</p> <p>RM170 million in total for access of financing via TEKUN,</p> <p>SME Bank and Pelaburan Hartanah Berhad; and</p> <p>Fourth: RM50 million for entrepreneurship under Unit Peneraju</p> <p>Agenda Bumiputera, Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p> <p>58. The Government will continue to support strategic projects through financing programmes under Bank Pembangunan Malaysia Berhad, offering a 2% interest subsidy per annum via:</p> <p>First: the Sustainable Development Financing Fund size</p> <p>increased from RM1 billion to RM2 billion;</p> <p>Second: the RM1 billion Maritime &amp; Logistics Fund; and</p> <p>Third: the RM2 billion Industry Digitalisation Transformation Fund which will now also support the implementation of connectivity projects.</p> <p>59. Unlike the previous administration, which handed out small business loans to their politically-linked co-operatives the Pakatan Harapan administration has separated politics and public funding, by providing RM100 million for Small Business Loans (Program Pembiayaan Usahawan Perusahaan Kecil Komuniti Cina) for the Chinese community via Bank Simpanan Nasional with more than 380 branches throughout the country, at an interest rate of 4%.</p> <p>60. For Indian entrepreneurs, the Government will provide</p> <p>RM20 million under TEKUN Nasional’s Skim Pembangunan Usahawan Masyarakat India (SPUMI) which is expected to benefit 1,300 entrepreneurs at an interest rate of 4%.</p> <p>Restructuring Development Financial Institutions (DFIs)</p> <p>61. Development Financial Institutions (DFIs) play an important role as public institutions that support the nation’s development goals and serve the needs and requirements of the new economy. To strengthen the development finance ecosystem, Bank Negara Malaysia is proposing a 2-phase restructuring plan for our DFIs to form a new financial institution through the merger of Bank Pembangunan Malaysia, Danajamin Nasional, SME Bank, and the Export-Import Bank of Malaysia.</p> <p>Growing Islamic Finance</p> <p>62. This year, the Ministry of Finance established the Special Committee on Islamic Finance (JKKI) chaired by the Yang Berhormat Deputy Minister of Finance, with the main objective of further promoting and developing the Islamic Finance ecosystem.</p> <p>To position Malaysia as the centre of excellence for Islamic finance, this special committee will:</p> <p>First: formulate the Islamic Economic Blueprint, with all</p> <p>relevant agencies;</p> <p>Second: organise outreach initiatives and professional courses to</p> <p>promote deeper understanding of Islamic Finance nationwide.</p> <p>63. The current tax deductions on the cost of issuance and additional deductions on sukuk issuance costs under the principle of Wakalah will be extended for 5 years until year of assessment 2025.</p> <p>64. To further promote Islamic fund and Sustainable and Responsible Investment (SRI) fund management activity, the tax exemption for fund management companies managing Shariah compliant funds and SRI funds, and the tax deduction on the cost of issuing SRI Sukuk will be extended for another 3 years until year of assessment 2023.</p> <p>Strategy 4: Strengthening Economic Diversity</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>65. In order to achieve economic diversity to expand growth, there will be specific measures on four areas: green economy, agriculture, Research and Development (R&amp;D), and tourism.</p> <p>Green Growth and Energy for the Future</p> <p>66. As part of the liberalisation of the electricity market, the Government has decided to migrate the current power purchase system towards a wholesale market in the future. Renewable energy suppliers will also be able to compete directly in the retail market. The more transparent and competitive electricity market will ensure a lower cost of electricity for Malaysian consumers.</p> <p>67. The Government intends to attain Malaysia’s goal to generate 20% of our energy consumption from renewable sources by 2025. Last year, we had significantly expanded the qualifying list of green assets for Green Investment Tax Allowance (GITA) under the MyHijau directory. For Budget 2020, we are happy to announce that the GITA and Green Income Tax Exemption (GITE) incentives will be extended to 2023. A 70% income tax exemption of up to</p> <p>10 years will be given to companies undertaking solar leasing activities.</p> <p>68. Through Energy Performance Contracting (EPC), the upfront capital investment into energy saving equipment for Government buildings will be repaid through the savings in utility costs achieved. In 2020, the Government will accelerate EPC implementation for Government buildings, prioritising hospitals and education institutions.</p> <p>Commodity Development</p> <p>69. The Government is concerned by the impact of low commodity prices on the livelihoods of Malaysians in this sector, particular the smallholders. At the same time we are disappointed and unhappy with the staged efforts aimed at curtailing market access for our palm oil exports by the European Union (EU) and the United States. For the palm oil sector, this Government intends to support this industry with the following measures:</p> <p>First: RM550 million palm oil replanting loan fund for</p> <p>smallholders collateral-free at an interest rate of 2% per annum, with a tenure of 12 years including a 4 year moratorium on repayment. The replanting will be undertaken using the latest seedlings and also in compliance with Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) standards to ensure better productivity and marketability;</p> <p>Second: An allocation of RM27 million to support Malaysian Palm Oil Board’s (MPOB) efforts to market palm oil internationally and counter anti-palm oil campaigns;</p> <p>Third: Enhance implementation of biodiesel, with the B20</p> <p>biodiesel for the transport sector to be implemented by the end of 2020. This is expected to increase palm oil demand by 500,000 tonnes per annum.</p> <p>70. The Government recognises the hardships caused by low rubber prices and low yield during the rainy seasons. Hence we will allocate RM200 million for Bantuan Musim Tengkujuh to eligible rubber smallholders under RISDA and Lembaga Industri Getah Sabah (LIGS). The Government will provide RM100 million for Rubber Production Incentive in 2020 to enhance the income of smallholders faced with low rubber prices.</p> <p>71. The Government will allocate RM810 million for the welfare of FELDA community, as follows:</p> <p>First: RM250 million for an income enhancement program</p> <p>benefiting 11,600 settlers;</p> <p>Second: RM300 million to write-off the interest of the settlers’</p> <p>debts;</p> <p>Third: RM100 million for the FELDA water supply projects;</p> <p>Fourth: RM70 million for housing the new generation of FELDA</p> <p>settlers; and</p> <p>Fifth: RM90 million for the upgrading of FELDA roads and</p> <p>basic infrastructure.</p> <p>72. Separately, we will provide RM738 million for RISDA and Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority (FELCRA) to implement various income-generating programmes to benefit the more than 300,000 RISDA and 100,000 FELCRA smallholders.</p> <p>Increasing the Incomes of Farmers</p> <p>73. The Government has increased the allocation to the Ministry of Agriculture from RM4.4 billion in 2019 to RM4.9 billion in 2020, with a special focus towards enhancing incomes of farmers.</p> <p>74. For 2020, the Government proposes to increase the fishermen allowance from RM200 to RM250 per month, with a total allocation of RM152 million for 2020.</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>75. To help our farmers, fishermen and smallholders diversify their income, the Government is allocating a sum of RM150 million to facilitate crop integration to help supplement their income such as through chili, pineapple, coconut, watermelon and bamboo.</p> <p>76. Government also intends to make the glutinous rice a signature product of Langkawi Island and provide farmers with a higher income. To support this initiative, the Government will allocate RM30 million for the production of glutinous rice in Langkawi Island which is expected to benefit 1,200 farmers.</p> <p>77. To raise the padi yield, the Government will increase the allocation for padi inputs from RM796 million in 2019 to RM855 million in 2020 under the Skim Baja Padi Kerajaan Persekutuan (SBPKP) and Skim Insentif Pengeluaran Padi (SIPP). In addition, the Government will continue the subsidy for Padi Bukit and Padi Huma.</p> <p>78. Finally, we will allocate RM43 million for Agriculture Industry 4.0 to develop new crop varieties with higher productivity and quality.</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>Enhancing Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) Framework</p> <p>79. Malaysia’s global ranking has improved from 37th in the world in 2017 to 35th in the world in 2019 in the Global Innovation Index</p> <p>(GII) as published by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). However, we must not stop there. We will continue enhancing Malaysia’s R&amp;D framework by:</p> <p>First: Intensifying R&amp;D in the public sector with an</p> <p>allocation of RM524 million to Ministries and Public Agencies;</p> <p>Second: The Government will also allocate RM30 million for R&amp;D</p> <p>matching grants for collaborations with industry and academia to develop higher value added downstream uses of palm oil, specifically tocotrienol in pharmaceuticals and bio-jet fuel; and</p> <p>Third: The Government will establish a Research Management Agency, with an allocation of RM10 million to centralise and coordinate management of public research resources;</p> <p>Fourth:</p> <p>To promote commercialisation of R&amp;D from the public sector, research universities beginning with the</p> <p>University of Malaya, will establish a one-stop Innovation Office to transform intellectual property into commercially exploitable opportunities; and</p> <p>Fifth: IP-generated income based on the Modified Nexus</p> <p>Approach (MNA) derived from patents and copyright software will be given tax exemption for a period of up to 10 years.</p> <p>80. The Government will allocate RM11 million towards initiatives by the Ministry of Education in collaboration with Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Climate Change (MESTECC) to inculcate the Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) culture, encouraging more students into the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>Visit Malaysia 2020</p> <p>81. Visit Malaysia 2020 (VMY2020) is the Government’s primary effort to brand Malaysia as a top destination for tourism, with a target of achieving 30 million tourist arrivals. The Government will continue to allocate 50% of tourism tax to respective State Governments to support their efforts in conjunction with VMY2020. To fulfil the aspirations of VMY2020, the Government has allocated RM1.1 billion to the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture, including an allocation of RM90 million to drive awareness, promotions and programmes for the VMY2020 campaign. A substantial portion of the departure levy collected will be allocated for tourism infrastructure projects.</p> <p>82. To amplify the economic benefits of VMY2020, the Government will roll out a host of tax incentives targeted at the arts and tourism sector, such as:</p> <p>First: Income tax exemption be given for organisers of approved</p> <p>arts and cultural activities, approved international sports recreational competitions, and conferences organisers;</p> <p>Second: New investments in international theme park projects</p> <p>will be given income tax exemption of 100% of statutory income or Investment Tax Allowance of 100% to be set off against 70% for 5 years;</p> <p>Third: Increasing tax deductions given to companies sponsoring</p> <p>arts, cultural and heritage activities in Malaysia from RM700,000 to RM1,000,000 per year;</p> <p>Fourth: Accelerated Capital Allowance for expenditure incurred</p> <p>on the purchase of new locally assembled excursion bus to be fully claimed within 2 years; and</p> <p>Fifth: excise duty exemption of 50% for locally assembled</p> <p>vehicles be given to tour operators for the purchase of qualified new tourism vehicles.</p> <p>83. The funicular train service to Penang Hill will achieve more than 2 million passengers per year, exceeding its capacity. The Government will contribute RM100 million towards the construction of a new cable car system to Penang Hill, with any additional costs to be financed by the State Government.</p> <p>84. In addition, the Government will allocate RM5 million to Cultural Economy Development Agency (CENDANA) to support Malaysian visual art galleries and exhibition organisers in holding art exhibitions. In addition, RM10 million will be allocated to Think City to preserve culture and urban heritage.</p> <p>85. Among the VMY2020 programmes, we are also having Malaysia Year of Healthcare Travel 2020 to solidify Malaysia’s leading position as a medical tourist destination in the region. Medical tourism is a rapidly expanding sector in Malaysia, growing</p> <p>17% annually from 2015 until 2018. In 2018, it generated</p> <p>RM1.5 billion revenue receipts from 1.2 million healthcare travellers. The Government will allocate RM25 million to the Malaysian Healthcare Tourism Council (MHTC) to strengthen the position of Malaysia as the preferred destination for health tourism in ASEAN for oncology, cardiology and fertility treatment.</p> <p>86. To date, e-visa applications are available for 10 countries, including China and India. To facilitate the visa application process, licensed travel agents under the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture (MoTAC) are allowed to submit group application for up to 100 people per transaction through the eNTRI and eVISA system.</p> <p>SECOND THRUST: INVESTING IN MALAYSIANS - LEVELLING UP HUMAN CAPITAL</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>87. Growth is necessary, but not sufficient to ensure Shared Prosperity. Economic growth must see that all Malaysians can participate meaningfully, and the fruits are shared equitably. There are three interrelated challenges that we face now in our labour market that need to be addressed.</p> <p>88. Firstly, we are concerned with more than half a million unemployed Malaysians in 2018, of which roughly 140,000 are graduates. Additionally out of those unemployed, about 290,000 of them were youth up to 24 years old.</p> <p>89. Secondly, the gender gap in our employment remains sizeable despite making significant progress in the past few years with the appointment of the first woman Deputy Prime Minister, Chief Justice and Chief Commissioner of SPRM. Female labour force participation rate continues to stagnate at around 55%, far from our target of 60%. A recent World Bank study concluded that if all barriers against Malaysian women are removed and women’s participation in our economy is increased, the country’s income per capita could grow by 26.2%.</p> <p>90. Thirdly, Malaysia has become overly dependent on low-skilled labour, especially foreign workers. Cheap foreign labour disincentivises companies from investing in more productive capital and technology. As of end-2018, there were officially 2.2 million foreign workers, or 15% of the national labour force of 15 million people. We must reverse the addiction to low-skilled foreign labour, while recognising the many challenges industries face in securing adequate workforce for their industry.</p> <p>Strategy 5: Enhancing job opportunities for Malaysians</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>Malaysians@Work</p> <p>91. Recognising the key challenges we face, the Government will be launching the Malaysians@Work initiative, aimed at simultaneously creating better employment opportunities for youth and women and reducing our over-dependence on low-skilled foreign workers. Very simply, Malaysians@Work is divided into four programmes directed at providing both wage incentives for workers and hiring incentives for employers as follows:</p> <p>First: Graduates@Work is designed specifically for the hiring of</p> <p>graduates who have been unemployed for more than 12 months. The graduates who secures work will receive a wage incentive of RM500 per month, for a duration of two 2 years, while employers receive a hiring incentive up to RM300 per month for each new hire, for 2 years;</p> <p>Second: Women@Work seeks to create 33,000 job opportunities</p> <p>per year for women who have stopped working for a year or more, and are between 30-50 years-old. The wage incentive for returning women workers is RM500 per month for two years, and a corresponding hiring incentive for employers up to RM300 per month for 2 years. On top of the above, the current income tax exemption for women who return to work after a career break be extended for another 4 years until 2023;</p> <p>Third:</p> <p>Locals@Work is a hiring cost equalisation programme, aimed at incentivising the shift away from low-skilled foreign workers dependency. The wage incentive for Malaysians who are hired to replace foreign workers is at either RM350 or RM500 per month, depending on the sectors, for a duration of two 2 years, and corresponding hiring incentive for employers up to RM250 per month for 2 years; and</p> <p>Fourth: Apprentice@Work is a TVET incentive programme,</p> <p>aimed at encouraging more youth to enter TVET courses, in the form of additional RM100 per month on existing allowance for trainees on apprenticeships. The Government will also extend double tax deduction on expenses incurred by companies participating in Skim Latihan Dual Nasional (SLDN) for another two years. In addition, the double tax deduction currently given to companies undertaking Structured Internship Programme (SIP) approved by Talent Corporation Malaysia Berhad (TalentCorp) will be expanded to include students from all academic fields rather than just engineering and technology.</p> <p>92. The Government believes that Malaysians@Work programme will enable Malaysians who are unemployed to gain the necessary skill sets and capabilities with on-the-job training, to ensure continued employment with the relevant company, with the retention rate expected to exceed 90% after the incentive ends in two years. This will build human capital from the unemployed to become a self-reliant worker, able to contribute productively to the labour market.</p> <p>93. Other than the Apprentice@Work programme, the</p> <p>Malaysians@Work initiatives will be managed by the EPF, and will be subsequently integrated with the Employment Insurance System (EIS) as well as other active labour market programmes. The Government anticipates that the Malaysians@Work initiative will cost RM6.5 billion over five years and create an additional 350,000 jobs for Malaysians and reduce foreign workers dependency by more than 130,000.</p> <p>94. The Government will also be undertaking further measures to improve the working environment for women and parents in general. In year 2019, RM10 million was allocated for the development early childhood care facilities in government buildings. Through this, 66 new TASKAs were created in government facilities. The Government will allocate an additional RM30 million in 2020 to provide more TASKAs, focusing especially on hospitals and schools. In addition, to ease the financial burden of parents who enrol their children in registered nurseries and kindergartens, individual tax relief for fees paid will be increased from RM1,000 to RM2,000.</p> <p>Strategy 6: Modernising the Labour Market</p> <p>95. In addition to creating new employment opportunities, the Government will also continuously pursue efforts to modernise our labour market and enhance the employment conditions of workers.</p> <p>96. In order to remain relevant with the current needs of the labour market, the Government will review the Employment Act 1955, which includes the following:</p> <p>FIRST: In order to increase maternity leave from 60 days to 90</p> <p>days effective 2021,</p> <p>SECOND: Extend the eligibility to overtime from those earning less</p> <p>RM2,000 to those earning less than RM4,000 per month;</p> <p>THIRD: Improve protection and procedures for handling sexual</p> <p>harassment complaints, and;</p> <p>FOURTH: Introduce new provisions on the prohibition of</p> <p>discrimination on religion, ethnicity, and gender.</p> <p>97. The Pakatan Harapan Government is committed to improve livelihoods, particularly for lower income groups. The Government had increased the minimum wage to RM1,100 per month effective January 2019. In balancing the needs of employees and employers, the Government takes cognisance of the higher cost of living in major urban centres, the Government proposes to increase the minimum wage rate only in major cities to RM1,200 per month effective 2020.</p> <p>Tan Sri Speaker Sir,</p> <p>Enhancing social protection</p> <p>98. With the ever changing work environment, the existing mechanism for social protection for workers will also need to be enhanced. In this regard:</p> <p>First: The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) will extend</p> <p>coverage to contract workers, for those under Contract for Services and Professionals. As a start, this will be a voluntary scheme for workers in the arts and entertainment industry via collaboration between EPF and the National Film Development Corporation Malaysia (FINAS) before extending the coverage to other sectors; and</p> <p>Second: The current Self-Employment Social Security Scheme by</p> <p>the Social Security Organisation (SOCSO) will be expanded to enable contributions by other selfemployed groups across 18 key sectors, such as fishermen, farmers, sole proprietors and partnerships.</p> <p>99. SOCSO will build a new RM500 million rehabilitation centre in Perak to mirror the success of the SOCSO Rehabilitation Centre in Melaka. The new centre will be equipped with the latest technology including robotics, trauma treatment and with a centre of excellence for prevention of accidents, in collaboration with relevant agencies.</p> <p> </p>\r\n",

      "<p>A KEY success factor for any entrepreneur is embracing lifelong learning to ensure business sustainability in changing times. That mindset was evident from the interest shown by the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) who tapped into the collective wisdom of experienced entrepreneurs at the recent SOBA LAB held in Menara Star, Petaling Jaya.</p> <p>There was much to glean from the story of electronics chain store Senheng Electric (KL) Sdn Bhd over the years.</p> <p>No stranger to turbulent times, its founder and managing director Lim Kim Heng shares the six transformations Senheng has undergone to stay competitive in the market.</p> <p>Among the most notable was its 2002 move to a fixed price model. Lim wanted to kickstart an aggressive expansion plan, but was limited due to the lack of talents skilled in price negotiation. He went against the current to launch fixed prices for Senheng’s products.</p> <p> </p><div class=\"embeded-image inline-image-center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/01CA5F77-C411-41C7-8B62-0152F0ED7FB9\" style=\"width: 350px; height: 334px;\"/></div> <p>The backlash was instantaneous, with business falling 25% in the first and second months, continuing well into its fifth month. To turn the tide, Lim introduced a loyalty card concept, which saw double digit sales growth for 11 years consecutively. </p> <p>“Before we launched fixed prices, there was no trust at all between customers and the shops. There’s no way to build trust if we’re both cheating each other, which was why I insisted on building loyalty to change the conversation from (purchasing products for) discounts to features,” he says.</p> <p>Along the way, he launched SenQ to target a different market. The shift to online shopping in 2014 also prompted further changes, as Senheng’s business dropped 6% to 7% for three consecutive years. </p> <p>Taking it in stride, he did his research and implemented several digital transformation initiatives, culminating in the 2017’s launch of a new retail concept he calls Seamless, which integrates its online and offline business, logistics and big data among others.</p> <p>The commonality among each transformation is Lim’s persistence in learning and adapting with the times.</p> <p> </p><div class=\"embeded-image inline-image-center\"><img alt=\"Growing responsibly: P’ng says giving handouts is not the way to do CSR right.\" src=\"https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/33E42E50-0305-4B2A-99B4-178F9F33375A\" style=\"width: 350px; height: 391px;\"/> <div class=\"inline-caption\">Growing responsibly: P’ng says giving handouts is not the way to do CSR right.  </div> </div> <p>Attendees also benefited from the expertise of Prof Muhaya Eye &amp; Lasik Centre Sdn Bhd chief executive officer Muhammad Addaem Mikhail Chandran, who spoke on the necessity of creating and executing a growth plan with a keen eye on financials.</p> <p>The key, he says, is managing priorities. The eye centre’s core pillar – like most other companies – lies in human resources. Thus, it is vital to put in place strong programmes for talent management and leadership development.</p> <p>“Numbers are important, but the organisation’s health is also important. A lot of companies fail because there is no sustainability in talents, so it’s something I pay a lot of attention to,” he says.</p> <p>Similar to Senheng’s Lim, Addaem also emphasises continuous learning, but adds that networking is also needed.</p> <p> </p><div class=\"embeded-image inline-image-center\"><img alt=\"Good partner: Azlina hopes to address SME pain points through its ecosystem.\" src=\"https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/E4FCC866-AB79-41DB-AC2E-5EEF9DB93B43\" style=\"width: 350px; height: 308px;\"/> <div class=\"inline-caption\">Good partner: Azlina hopes to address SME pain points through its ecosystem.  </div> </div> <p>For Hernan Corporation Sdn Bhd founder and chief executive officer Anna Teo, SMEs have to be proactive and approach relevant government agencies such as Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation (Matrade) to seek help.</p> <p>She briefly touched on the different local agencies that support SMEs with resources for growth and says, “Be proactive and approach government agencies to see how they can help you. Find out. Dare to ask. You won’t get anything being in your comfort zone or by not trying. Leverage the resources made available by these agencies.”</p> <p>That said, she cautions against complacency or taking such assistance for granted. When attending trade missions or trade exhibitions overseas, for instance, she advises SMEs to do their research, pre-arrange to meet buyers and set specific targets to achieve.</p> <p>“Make it worth it.

For example, through the Outreach Programme in 2018, SME Bank had approved financing of RM257.17mil. We have conducted this programme in 14 locations nationwide and met up with existing and new SMEs for possible opportunities to assist them in financing,” he said in an interview. </p> <p>In terms of SME financing, the biggest exposure was the services sector which formed 56% of total financing, followed by construction and manufacturing. </p> <p>On whether the bank was exercising stringent lending, Aria Putera said SME Bank was different from other commercial banks in that it has been mandated by the government to assist the unserved and underserved SMEs to obtain financing.</p> <p>Towards this end, he said the bank reviewed loan applications objectively. Business viability, market opportunity and compliance with financial terms and agreements were the criteria when approving loans.</p> <p>“The bank has been working with various agencies and our internal teams to assess, for example, which states needed genuine financing. It is not a one-size-fits-all type of approach,” Aria Putera noted.</p> <p>Among others, the bank provides various initiatives, one of which is via its subsidiary, Centre for Entrepreneur Development and Research (Cedar). The role of Cedar is to provide facilities beyond financing like training to entrepreneurs and holding roadshows to assist them. More than 38,000 participants have benefited from business coaching and training sessions conducted by Cedar.</p> <p>The lender also provides an “intervention role” to develop SMEs via a hand-holding approach from the entry point to inculcate business acumen among entrepreneurs, he said, adding that a total of 1,503 SMEs have successfully migrated to a higher level. </p> <p>These included expansion into the export market, improvement in technology and higher growth in profit.</p> <p>Via the Best Exporters Programme (BEP), it has helped SMEs to further boost their exports. As of December 2018, 73 companies had enrolled in the BEP and total export sales during the period stood at RM384.07mil. Twenty new exporters were created last year and 52 companies recorded incremental values in their export sales.</p> <p>According to Aria Putera, the bank adopts the Performance Measurement Framework, an initiative by Bank Negara aimed at ensuring that all development financial institutions would be measured on the outcome of their mandated role. This includes placing the focus on developing and implementing high-impact programmes for SMEs in targeted sectors in line with the mandate set by the government.</p> <p>SME Bank is also embarking on a two-year transformation programme. This is to enhance its role in providing financial assistance and capacity-building to assist the development of the SMEs. </p> <p>Describing the SME Bank digital transformation as a game-changer, he said it would revolve around implementing the digital transformation plan to revolutionise the way SME entrepreneurs are being supported and developed. </p> <p>“SME Bank’s digital transformation will be a part of the National SME Digital Platform, which will provide a clear demarcation on the targeted segments. It will create a greater synergy between agencies and avoid overlapping and be more focused towards the bank’s targeted segment. This will increase the income contribution of SME Bank from fee-based income by providing the above services,” he added. </p> <p>The National SME Digital Platform is targeted to be launched in the third quarter of this year.</p> <p>For the digital transformation programme, SME Bank is collaborating with its partners including Orion IXL, <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=TM\" target=\"_blank\">Telekom Malaysia Bhd</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=TM\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a> and Commerce.Asia.</p> <p>On the SME Bank 90-Day Biz Challenge programme competition, Aria Putera said: “Collectively, the 20 finalists have garnered net sales of RM102,829.26 within just four months of the competition.</p> <p>“This is a good start, as the participants of this competition are still studying and are not able to operate the business on a full-time basis.”</p> <p>To further expand the reach of the competition, starting this year, the 90-Day Biz Challenge was opened to all polytechnic students throughout the country in addition to the community college students.</p> <p>The competition was organised through an online platform where participants have to submit their business plans through the www.YourSuccessOurStory.com portal. </p> <p>A total of 192 entries were received with the involvement of 768 students. </p> <p>This is an increase of 120% in participation compared with  2017.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>KUALA LUMPUR: The Islamic banking industry needs to explore ways to attract more deposits in the wake of stiff competition from institutional funds. </p> <p>Islamic banking veteran Datuk Badlisyah Abdul Ghani said Islamic banks were struggling to raise deposits from the consumer market.</p> <p>“A substantial amount of Islamic funds are now placed with institutional funds in the likes of Permodalan Nasional Bhd and Lembaga Tabung Haji. As a result, there is an ongoing struggle to attract funds into the Islamic banking space.</p> <p>“The big chunk of the deposits in Islamic banks are institutional deposits,’’ he told StarBiz.   </p> <p>Badlisyah, who is also the president of the Chartered Institute of Islamic Finance Professionals (CIIF), added that Islamic banks need to do more to attract funds and spur growth.  </p> <p>Although he expected growth in Islamics but it was still relatively small compared with conventional deposits.</p> <p>In the past, he noted that Islamic deposits had been growing by double-digit but now it was growing by a single-digit.  </p> <p>Badlisyah noted that it was a concern if one were to look at the asset size of both Islamic and conventional banking.</p> <p>For Islamic banking, with its total asset size of about RM917bil, it should be growing by at least a double-digit if not by triple-digit. This total asset size figure includes development financial institutions.</p> <p>But this is not the case, he said, noting that at the same time, this was merely an adjustment phase for the Islamic banking industry similar to other industries. </p> <p>On Islamic banking asset,  Badlisyah said it had been growing albeit at a moderate rate.</p> <p>He attributed it to, among others, the consolidation in the Islamic banking space and compliance of new rules required by the regulators. He viewed this as temporary and was confident banks would continue with their asset building exercise once they have sorted out the above issues.</p> <p>Meanwhile, RAM Ratings in its latest edition on Islamic banking said Islamic financing is still anchoring the growth of the overall Malaysian banking sector.</p> <p>It noted that Islamic banking continued to expand at a much faster pace than conventional loans in 2018, coming in at 11% (2017: 10.3%), in contrast to the latter’s 3.3% growth.</p> <p>As of end-January 2019, Islamic financing comprised some 32% of the overall system’s loans.</p> <p>The rating agency expected financing growth of the Islamic banking sector to stand at around 10% to 11% in 2019. </p> <p>As for the value-based intermediation (VBI) which is gaining momentum in Islamic finance,  Badlisyah noted that this practice was good for Islamic finance over the long term albeit some hiccups in the short term.</p> <p>He said banks would need, to be not only profit-centric but also socially-oriented. </p> <p>Over the long term, VBI would strengthen Islamic banking including earning prospects and outweigh costs. VBI is an intermediation function that aims to deliver the intended outcomes of syariah through practices, conduct and offerings that generate positive and sustainable impact to the economy, community and environment, consistent with the shareholders’ sustainable returns and long-term interests.</p> <p>The biggest challenge for Islamic banks Badlisyah said, is complacency. </p> <p>There is growth in the industry but only single-digit and more must be done to spur the industry.</p> <p>Although the Islamic banking industry has invested the best resources and infrastructure but there is still room for further growth, he stressed. </p> <p>“There must be self-reflection on the part of the industry as to what  needs to be done to further propel Islamic banking. This is the question which needs to addressed by the industry,” he said.</p> <p>As for the CIIF, which have about 1,000 members, Badlisyah said some time this month, the professional body would be introducing the Chartered Professionals in Islamic Finance.</p> <p>He said this would be a valuable qualification which would give a shot in the arm for  Islamic finance. </p> <p>CIIF is the only International Islamic Professional body in the world which is based in Malaysia.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>AS part of ongoing efforts to promote continued access to financing for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), Bank Negara conducted a survey in 2018 to obtain a better understanding of the financing needs and behaviour of SMEs.</p> <p>According to Bank Negara’s annual report 2018, a total of 1,529 formal SME businesses participated in the survey, which covered firm and entrepreneur characteristics, business performance and challenges, as well as access to finance and usage of financial services.</p> <p>“The survey showed that more than 90% of the SMEs served the domestic market, with 7% exporting their products and services. About 83% of SMEs reported utilising information and communications technology (ICT) in their business operations, with 22% that have their own website and 14% that operate online stores.</p> <p>“More than half of the respondents (53%) used professional services including auditors, accountants or financial advisors to manage their financial accounts,” says the central bank.</p> <p>Despite the challenging business environment in the first quarter of 2018, the majority of SMEs (71%) recorded profit margins of above 10% and were able to maintain positive cash flows, says Bank Negara.</p> <p>“Manufacturing firms reported higher levels of productivity and paid higher wages for new graduate hires compared to other sectors.”</p> <p>On financing, the central bank says respondents reported utilising funds from a variety of sources, both internal and external, with own cash contributions being the main source.</p> <p>“Among other funding sources, about 27% of the respondents had facilities with financial institutions, followed by family and friends, internally-generated funds and micro-finance institutions.</p> <p>“In the micro-enterprise segment, 22% had financing facilities with financial institutions, including 9% of respondents who secured financing under the Pembiayaan Mikro facility.”</p> <p>Bank Negara says sources of financing also vary through the business life cycle.</p> <p>“At the initial stage, young firms tend to rely on their own cash and informal sources such as family and friends. This is consistent with most research findings, which attribute such behaviour typical of young firms to information opacity; lack of collateral, track record and financial skills; as well as high transactional costs.</p> <p>“As businesses mature (typically after five years in operation), they tend to rely more on external financing in the form of both debt and equity, including bank financing.”</p> <p>Among the SMEs that had applied for financing, most indicated that they were able to secure financing, says the central bank.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1240\" src=\"https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/3891908B-826C-4E6A-8C7A-EF390E883C56\" width=\"513\"/></p> <p>“About 22% of the respondents had applied for financing in the six months prior to the survey, with the majority (94%) of their applications being approved.”</p> <p>About 13% applied to financial institutions with 91% of their total financing applications approved, while the remaining 9% applied to other sources, with a 99% approval rate.</p> <p>Women-owned firms reported higher demand for financing (33% of women-owned firms applied versus 22% for all respondents), but experienced a lower approval rate of 83% (overall: 94%) mainly due to the lack of track record and insufficient documentation.</p> <p>“Most of these firms obtained unsecured financing from micro-finance institutions, banking institutions and development financial institutions,” Bank Negara says, adding that about 44% of the respondents were first-time borrowers.</p> <p>“The main purposes of the financing applications were for the purchase of assets (building, property, machinery and equipment: 23%), working capital (22%) and starting a new business (19%).”</p> <p>On average, the majority of the applications (89%) was approved within one month and the funds were disbursed within the subsequent month, says the central bank.</p> <p>The survey also provided insights on SMEs’ usage of other financial services, such as insurance, takaful and e-payments.</p> <p>“More than half of the respondents have insurance or takaful products, although this was less prevalent among micro-enterprises. </p> <p>“While the current take-up has been low, potential future demand for insurance and takaful by SMEs is significant for all products across the board, with emerging interest particularly in securing protection for risks associated with cyber security, professional indemnity, payment default and damages in crops.”</p> <p>The survey noted that SMEs mainly made electronic payments, but preferred cash in receiving payments from customers.</p> <p>“It was also observed that cheques remained popular for payments to suppliers and other business to business transactions.”</p> <p><strong>Underlying challenges in financing</strong></p> <p>With regards to challenges, the survey reveals that financing barriers mainly relate to documentation, costs and business viability.</p> <p>“Among the key constraints to business growth, difficulty in accessing sufficient financing was ranked low, second to last out of the nine constraints identified by SMEs,” says the central bank.</p> <p>It says SMEs that experienced rejections of their financing applications cited insufficient documentation, insufficient cash flow to meet repayments and non-viable business plans as the main reasons for rejection.</p> <p>“SMEs involved in automation, innovation, manufactures of goods, and exports experienced higher rejection rates compared to the overall SMEs. Firms that automated stated insufficient collateral and projects perceived to be of higher risk as key reasons for rejection.</p> <p>“The rejected applications were mainly for the purchase of machinery and equipment and ICT tools, as well as undertaking research and development.”</p> <p>Bank Negara says these projects could be deemed to be higher risk as they may involve moveable and intangible assets with low salvage value in the event of commercial failure and involve the use of new and untested processes with high uncertainty on returns.</p> <p>“Innovative firms cited insufficient documentation as a key factor for rejection. Exporting and manufacturing firms that faced greater difficulty obtaining financing were mainly firms that were newly established with limited repayment track records.</p> <p>“Businesses that needed financing but did not apply (41%) were either cautious in taking on debt, unsure of their repayment capacity, or found the application process too difficult.”</p> <p>The survey revealed that about 46% of the respondents stated that the financing products offered by financial institutions did not meet their business needs due to high financing costs (50%), insufficient financing amount (42%) and onerous documentation requirements (29%).</p> <p>“The average financing rate that respondents were willing to pay was 3.88%, well below the average lending rates to SMEs of 6.18% at the time of the survey (second quarter 2018).”</p> <p>The survey also indicated that the main constraints to SME growth were factors associated with operating and business conditions, namely increasing competition (69% of respondents), fluctuating demand (51%), rising input costs (44%) and rising labour costs (40%).</p>\r\n",

      "<p>IF we were to believe the hype whipped up by some politicians following the formation of the new government, the Malays in our country are in danger of losing everything.</p> <p>Planting fear and, using race and religion, has always been an effective emotional political weapon.</p> <p>Throw in threats of racial riots and soon, the temperature shoots up. It doesn’t help when counter arguments come in the form of equally distasteful racist remarks.</p> <p>These shenanigans usually only involve a handful of desperate politicians, likely the ones who lost in the general election, or are being investigated for corruption. Then there are some very loud co-operatives – presumably paid – who amplify their voices through social media.</p> <p>Only the ignorant would believe the incredible claims made up by these politicians.</p> <p>In Malaysia, almost all the institutions are dominated by Malays, including the civil service, police, army and the government. Just take a cursory look at the racial makeup of the Members of Parliament and senators at the Dewan Rakyat and Dewan Negara.</p> <p>Of the country’s 30 million-plus population, more than 60% are Malays, and those numbers will continue to grow while that of the Chinese and Indians keep shrinking.</p> <p>The Chinese population in Malaysia has consistently been declining from the early days of independence, from 37.6 % in 1957 to 24.6% in 2010, and 21.4% in 2015, due to a lower birth rate as well as a high level of emigration in recent decades.</p> <p>According to a news report in 2016, by 2030, the number of Chinese – the second largest ethnic group after the Malays – in Malaysia will drop to third place after the bumiputra and foreign migrant workers.</p> <p>A huge dip in the birth rate of the Chinese to 1.4 babies per family in 2015 from 7.4 in 1957 and a sharp rise in the numbers of foreign workers, are now threatening the Chinese’ position as the second largest grouping in Malaysia.</p> <p>The report, quoting projected data from the Department of Statistics, said the population percentage of local ethnic Chinese will shrink to 19.6% in 2030, from 24.6% in 2010 and 21.4% in 2015.</p> <p>The Chinese percentage is also projected to fall further to 18.9% in 2035.</p> <p>In the report, Chief Statistician Datuk Dr Hasan Abdul Rahman said that although the Chinese population will increase to 7.1 million people in 2040 from 6.6 million now, the percentage compared to the Malays and Indians might decline to 18.4% in 2040.</p> <p>In terms of numbers, the other two ethnic groups are projected to rise, with the bumiputra outdoing everyone else.</p> <p>The bumiputra population is anticipated to increase from 19.2 million in 2015 to 26 million by 2040, and Indians from two million to 2.3 million.</p> <p>The bumiputra population is anticipated to increase from 61.8% to 67.5%, and Indians from 5.5% to 6.4%.</p> <p>This huge Malay demographic simply means that the Malay electorate will be significantly broad.</p> <p>Looking at the country’s 1.6 million-strong civil service, Bernama reported in 2016 of then Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department Shahidan Kassim saying that as of December 2014, the ethnic composition of the civil service was as follows: 78.8% Malays, Bumiputera Sabah (6.1%), Bumiputera Sarawak (4.8 %), Chinese (5.2 %), Indians (4.1 %), Other Bumiputera (0.3%) and Others (0.7%).</p> <p>In the case of the powerful police force, then Home Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said in 2016 that the police needed more non-Malays to enlist as they currently make up only 5% of the 133,212-strong force.</p> <p>“Of the total, 80.23% (106,871) are Malays, while Chinese make up only 1.96% (2,615), Indians 3.16% (4,209), Punjabis 0.21% (275) and others 14.44% (19,242),” he told Parliament.</p> <p>The Malaysian Army, Royal Malaysian Navy and Royal Malaysian Air Force are also overwhelmingly populated by Malays. According to a news report, the Malaysian army comprises 98.3% Malays and 0.2% Chinese with officers making up 96.2%, out of which 1.4% are Chinese.</p> <p>That’s a far cry from the pre-independence days when the police, especially, had a decent number of Chinese, which was instrumental in our successful thwarting of the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) insurgents and urban terrorists.</p> <p>It was the infiltration of these Chinese policemen into the CPM, with the many dangerous and highly classified covert operations of the police Special Branch and military intelligence, which defeated the CPM.</p> <p>From the 1960s to the late 1970s, non-Malay armed forces personnel comprised about 30% of the total manpower while the navy and air force, excluding the army, had a higher percentage. Over the years, this figure gradually dropped to the current 5%.</p> <p>Certainly, no one is blaming the government for this situation since it has openly encouraged non-Malays to join.</p> <p>The responsibility of defending the country and the people should be shared by all Malaysians, so, it would be terribly unfair if this mammoth burden is only shouldered by the Malays. However, a combination of factors, including perceived low chances of promotion, has deterred many non-Malays from joining the ranks.</p> <p>Despite the tiny representation of the non-Malays in the services, especially the police, the men and women in uniform have performed professionally.</p> <p>Non-Malays feel secure and protected, even in the wake of incidents involving Malay attackers, and this must be remembered.</p> <p>And in the case of the economy, despite the large number of Chinese businessmen who continue to be listed among Malaysia’s richest, it has long been acknowledged that the Malays are now firmly in control of major banks, government-linked companies (GLCs) and top posts in the private sector.</p> <p>According to Prof Dr Terence Gomez, the GLCs hold sway over some RM1 trillion ($333 billion) worth of investments. According to his research, the seven GLCs control 35 of the top 100 listed companies in Malaysia, whose combined market capitalisation accounts for 42% of the market cap of all the listed companies on Bursa Malaysia.</p> <p>Many of these companies operate in key sectors of the economy, such as utilities, infrastructure, property and telecommunications. For example, some of MoF Inc’s key assets and investments include Petroliam Nasional Bhd, Khazanah Nasional, UDA Holdings Bhd, Keretapi Tanah Melayu Bhd, MRT Corp Sdn Bhd, Syarikat Prasarana Negara Bhd, SRC International Sdn Bhd as well as several development financial institutions. Khazanah Nasional’s investments include CIMB Group Bhd, UEM Group Bhd, PLUS Malaysia Bhd, Iskandar Investment Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd, TIME dotCom Bhd, IHH Healthcare Bhd, Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd, Malaysia Airports Holdings and Malaysia Airlines Bhd.</p> <p>But while these Malays, on the surface at least, seem to be enjoying power and high income from government-linked companies, many ordinary Malays in the rural and urban areas, sadly, still struggle daily.</p> <p>The years of affirmative action have created a broad base of the middle class, which is crucial and essential for a stable Malaysia, but many of the effects have not fully trickled down to the destitute.</p> <p>It’s these Malays who need help the most, and surely, they are the most deserving, too, but wealth has been plundered and looted by corrupt politicians who are now preaching the politics of hatred to their audience.</p> <p>Cut off from the access of rational and sound arguments in Bahasa Malaysia, the rhetoric of race and religion has found faithful listeners who buy into their bluff of Malays being threatened and in danger of losing their rights in the country, a privilege belonging to them solely, and no other Malaysians.</p> <p>Having a Finance Minister of Chinese ethnicity and an Attorney General of Indian origin are enough to trigger fears, never mind the fact that the government machinery is entirely Malay. And suddenly, ICRED has taken over 1MDB as the prime issue of the country.</p> <p>Never mind if their listeners can’t even pronounce the acronym and are largely clueless to what it’s all about, but for some reason, they seem convinced it takes away Malay rights and Islam.</p> <p>Politicians in this country, including those in power now, are no angels, although they would like to be viewed as the new breed of Malaysian politicians supposedly blind to race.</p> <p>Many have used the race and religion card themselves, even staging massive protests, but are now criticising the opposition for the same thing. It’s a classic case of the pot calling the kettle black.</p> <p>In some ways, some of our new ministers have also failed to handle the civil service well, given the crass way they have dealt with the more experienced and knowledgeable senior government officers.</p> <p>Instead of winning them over – as they, too, settle into the new political dynamic and culture – some inexperienced ministers, with their new-found power and authority, ignore their advice.</p> <p>Malaysia has been drained of copious amounts of money as a result of looting, so, we really have no time for any hysterics, as we need to get back to the economy race and lift our heads high again.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>DURING the GE14 campaign period, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad had famously referred to Malaysia’s complex ownership structure of government-linked companies (GLCs) as a “monster”. </p> <p>There was irony in this statement because Dr Mahathir, after all, had a played a leading role in crea­ting this structure that has enterpri­ses in every sector of the economy.</p> <p>However, he noted too that this structure was created to serve a “noble vision”, but the GLCs had evolved into tools exploited by politicians to serve their vested interests. </p> <p>There is undoubtedly a deep sense of frustration among Malay­sians, particularly business people, about the pervasiveness of GLCs in the economy. </p> <p>The contention is that the GLCs crowd out private firms in key economic segments, except the industrial and manufacturing sectors.</p> <p>Under Barisan Nasional, there had been numerous promises to reform the GLCs, particularly during economic crises.</p> <p>Critics also note that the presence of influential politicians in the GLCs has weakened managerial practices, undermining the performance of these firms. </p> <p>Through GLCs, corrupt politicians have channelled concessions to private companies in exchange for campaign contributions.</p> <p>Something must be urgently done about the GLCs. However, what is brewing as Malaysia embarks on an arduous journey of instituting reforms is a serious divide in opinion about how to deal with these GLCs.</p> <p>The most commonly articulated panacea is to privatise the GLCs. Unfortunately, it is not so simple. This debate assumes a homogenisation of GLCs when in fact there is a variety of such institutions that play different roles in the economy. </p> <p><strong>How we got here</strong></p> <p>The introduction of the New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1970 precipitated extensive government intervention in the economy. The NEP was a progressive 20-year affirmative action plan to eradicate poverty and equitably redistribute wealth between ethnic groups. Bumiputera corporate ownership then stood at a mere 1.5%. </p> <p>Government intervention entailed establishing public enterprises to acquire primarily foreign-owned businesses. These public enterprises, later renamed GLCs, were also introduced at the federal and state levels to play a developmental role in the economy.</p> <p>Among these GLCs were development financial institutions tasked with nurturing domestic SMEs, funding ventures in new sectors and promoting R&amp;D. </p> <p>Other GLCs included sectoral-based institutions to achieve core development goals and socioeconomic-type statutory bodies.</p> <p>After Dr Mahathir was first appointed Prime Minister in 1981, he embarked on privatisation,  par­tly to rid the government of the huge number of GLCs, but also to create a new breed of bumiputra entrepreneurs who owned business conglomerates of international repute.</p> <p>He achieved this goal but the 1997 Asian currency crisis unravelled his plans. </p> <p>The government had to renationalise many of these privatised companies, creating again a public sector that owned a large number of GLCs.</p> <p>A plan was initiated to reform GLCs, mainly those listed on the stock exchange. Professionals from the private sector were hired to manage them, while politicians were removed from their boards of directors.</p> <p>These professionals, most of whom had never served in government, were paid salaries benchmarked against private sector remuneration, an issue of much contention today. </p> <p>Another criticism was that these executives were subservient to the dictates of the Prime Minister. </p> <p>One outcome of this reform was that these GLCs emerged as leading firms. Since the turn of the century, GLCs have been among at least seven of Malaysia’s top 10 listed firms.</p> <p><strong>GLICs and listed GLCs</strong></p> <p>GLCs have, however, not evolved in a coherently linear direction. They are required to fulfil a range of business and social duties, implemented by different institutions.</p> <p>At the federal level, the GLCs are primarily owned by five savings- and investment-based institutions (the Employees Provident Fund, Retirement Fund (Inc), Lembaga Tabung Haji, Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera, and Permodalan Nasional Bhd), sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Bhd, and the government’s primary holding company, Minister of Finance Inc.</p> <p>Collectively termed as government-linked investment companies (GLICs), these seven vary considerably in size and objectives, and are ultimately controlled by the Finance Minister through a complex pyramid-type organisational structure.</p> <p>In early 2017, of the 900-odd companies listed on Bursa Malaysia, 70 were GLCs, that is, those with a GLIC as the largest shareholder. The 20 largest among these companies, known as the “G20”, accounted for about 42% of the exchange’s total market capitalisation.</p> <p>What is of concern is that the government has substantial equity interests – ranging from 5% to 37% – in 140 listed firms. However, the government is not the largest shareholder in these companies; instead, the majority owners are individuals or foreign enterprises.</p> <p>It is unclear why the government has sought to secure such huge shareholdings in these companies that it does not control. This sort of equity ownership could well be in order to earn dividends from the companies, but such shareholdings can lead to hostile takeovers.</p> <p>Business owners have long complained of expropriation of their companies by the government, ostensibly as part of its equity redistribution exercise. Fear of expropriation has undermined investor confidence and hampered R&amp;D endeavours to shape globally competitive enterprises.</p> <p><strong>Reforming the GLCs</strong></p> <p>Given the scale and scope of government involvement in the Malaysian economy, urgent reforms are necessary to ensure the GLCs function well and are taken out of the overwhelming control of politicians. There is no one remedy to deal with this colossal government-business complex. A thoughtful debate is imperative after a comprehensive study of these GLCs.</p> <p>In the short term, institutional reforms can be formulated to ensure accountable and transparent governance of the companies, specifically to address concentration of economic power in the Finance Ministry.</p> <p>Power has to be devolved to key oversight institutions such as Bank Negara, the Securities Commission and opposition-led parliamentary committees.</p> <p>Within GLCs, autonomous technocratic professionals must be employed, based on merit and not ethnicity, so that inefficiencies and abuse of power can be curbed. These professionals can be appointed by the Finance Minister, who will have jurisdiction over these GLCs, though subject to parliamentary oversight.</p> <p>In the long term, as part of the GLC reforms, there must be a review of how statutory bodies, holding companies and foundations function. The government should consider the implications of the restructuring on a sector-by-sector basis. The modes of reforms to be considered include divestment where government presence is not necessary, for example in construction, media and tourism.</p> <p>On the other hand, the government would need to retain ownership of GLCs in utilities, banking, oil and gas, defence, plantations, airport services and ports. </p> <p>The transfer of ownership of huge firms in these sectors to private investors may not serve the nation’s interest.</p> <p>However, in these cases, partial privatisation through the listing of the GLCs has been proposed as a way to raise funds while extending equity ownership to private investors. The government will retain control of these companies.</p> <p>While reforms are being debated, it must be considered that GLCs have played an important developmental role, creating a vibrant domestic privately-owned enterprise base, promoting mechanisms to encourage private firms to venture into new economic sectors, and enhancing the development of rural- and niche-based enterprises. GLCs must still play this role.</p> <p>Evidently, a number of issues must be reviewed when reforming this interlocking nexus of government and business. It is therefore surprising that the reform-minded Pakatan Harapan government has yet to act on this matter, even as debates about the GLCs gain  curency. </p> <p><strong>Edmund Terence Gomez is professor of political economy at the Faculty of Economics &amp; Administration, Universiti Malaya.

      "<p>KUALA LUMPUR: Two weeks after the Securities Commission issued a stern warning to investors putting money into cryptocurrencies, Bank Negara has now said it will be issuing its guidelines on the issue by year-end. </p> <p>Bank Negara governor Tan Sri Muhammad Ibrahim has been looking into the matter and the details, as the new form of currency has attracted a lot of attention around the globe.</p> <p>“We hope to come out with guidelines on cryptocurrencies before the end of the year: in particular, those relating to anti-money laundering and terrorist financing. We want to ensure that there are clear guidelines for those who want to participate in this sector,” he said on the sidelines of the Global Symposium on Development Financial Institutions.</p> <p>The central bank last commented on cryptocurrencies more than three years ago when a statement was issued on Jan 2, 2014 saying that bitcoin was not recognised as legal tender in Malaysia, and that it did not regulate the operations of bitcoin.</p> <p>“The public is, therefore, advised to be cautious of the risks associated with the usage of such digital currency,” it had earlier said.</p> <p>China clamped down on bitcoin recently, with news wire reports saying that the second-biggest economy in the world had seen several large bitcoin exchanges closing down after the government there banned fundraising using the cryptocurrency.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Muhammad reiterated that the ringgit should always be reflective of Malaysia’s economic strength and fundamentals.</p> <p>“What is important is not so much the level of the ringgit, but that the ringgit must reflect the economic strength of Malaysia. If economic growth and inflation are under control, then the exchange rates should reflect that,” Muhammad said.</p> <p>He said a company’s competitiveness should not be solely derived from exchange rate weakness and should also be measured on other factors.</p> <p>“It is very important that the ringgit reflects our fundamentals. We have been very clear to the cooperations that they should not just rely on the exchange rate for competitiveness. They should (also) rely on productivity and innovation to sell to others and cannot just rely on exchange rates when marketing abroad,” Muhammad said.</p> <p>He also said the central bank was monitoring closely inflation levels, given the rising local petrol prices.</p> <p>“The inflation numbers that we saw in the last monetary policy committee meeting is still within projections. Inflation numbers are very much dependent on global oil prices, and so far, we do not expect this to increase at such a rate that would have implications on inflation rate projections, not yet,” he said.</p> <p>“But we are always keeping an open mind. As the data comes in, we will look at the implications on inflation and we will certainly disseminate this information as it comes in,” he added.</p> <p>He said that with economic growth being entrenched and inflation sitting within the expected range, it gives Bank Negara a little room for flexibility in terms of policy formation.</p> <p>“The next meeting is in early November and we will look at the data again to see where we should position the economy. It is very important that our interest rate levels must be at a level that would promote growth and ensure inflation is managed strongly,” Muhammad said.</p> <p>In his speech, Muhammad said properly structured development institutions could be a potent agent of change for private-sector investment, drive growth and forge inclusive societies. </p> <p>He said that more than ever today, development financial institutions needed to step up to promote new growth areas. </p> <p>“They should perform a broader role to stimulate economic activity that would not otherwise take place. They could also improve the quality and scale of such activities. They can provide unique value propositions in terms of advisory and nurturing new growth sectors to become profitable, and thus, attractive for private investors,” he said.</p> <p>He highlighted the rise of the Korean cultural phenomenon known as the Korean Wave or “Hallyu”, now a new growth area for the Korean economy, with the exports of culture content, including films and music, at an estimated value of US$83.2bil.</p> <p>“This extraordinary rise of the Korean Wave can be attributed to the growth of investment in the creative industry. The industry was boosted by the government’s strategy to prioritise the sector as an engine of growth after the Asian financial crisis,” he said.</p> <p>“The Korean government had earmarked 1% of the national budget for development financial institutions to kickstart the sector. Following their footsteps, domestic conglomerates like Samsung and Daewoo started investing in film financing and video production,” Muhammad added.</p> <p>He said this example showed that development financial institutions were the first to spearhead investments in the film and music industry. </p> <p>“At that time, commercial banks did not have the capability to assess the viability of the industry, nor accept the intangible assets offered as collateral. It was only much later, when the industry recorded healthy profits, that private investments followed,” he said.</p> <p>“The success speaks for itself. Between 2008 and 2011, private domestic and foreign investments in the culture content industry had quadrupled to more than US$157mil,” he added.</p>\r\n",

      "                • Domestic financial stability was sustained amid bouts of heightened financial market volatility<br/> <br/> • Key potential sources of risks to domestic financial stability stemmed from high levels of domestic debt, elevated property prices in some segments of residential property, an oversupply of commercial property, and heightened volatility in financial markets.<br/> <br/> • Growth in household debt moderated further as households scaled back borrowings in line with loan affordability. <br/> <br/> • Total household debt as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) was lower at 88.4% (from 89.1% in 2015), as the pace of moderation in debt slowed below nominal GDP growth for the first time since 2010.<br/> <br/> • The debt burden of households was eased by slower growth in average house prices which increased by 5.3%, compared to an average of 9.5% during 2010-2015.<br/> <br/> • The debt servicing capacity of businesses continues to be well-supported with a median interest coverage ratio (ICR) of 9.4 times, comfortably above prudent standards.<br/> <br/> • Banking system liquidity comprising placements, reverse repos and statutory reserves with Bank Negara remains ample at RM167.4bil, which can be released to meet liquidity needs.<br/> <br/> • In 2017, conditions are expected to remain challenging for some businesses and households. <br/> <br/> • There is likely to be some deterioration in loan performance, but this is not expected to be broad-based given the strong asset quality of banks, stable labour market conditions and continued economic growth.<br/> <strong><br/> <strong>Banking Sector</strong></strong><br/> <br/> • Outstanding financing by the banking system expanded by 5.3% to RM1,521.5bil in 2016, mainly driven by financing to the household sector.<br/> <br/> • Banks continue to lend to SMEs, which grew by 9.2%. <br/> <br/> • Financing by development financial institutions to targeted growth sectors, including the agriculture sector, expanded by 5.7%. <br/> <br/> • Transactions conducted through the agent banking network increased to over 100 million transactions valued at RM8.5bil, performed at more than 7,900 agent banks across the country.<br/> <br/> • The profitability of banks improved in 2016, supported by gains from treasury activities and strong financing growth from Islamic banking operations.<br/> <strong><br/> <strong>Insurance and Takaful Sector</strong></strong><br/> <br/> • The insurance and takaful sector continued to show positive growth in 2016 supported by strong overall capitalisation.<br/> <br/> • Overall insurance penetration, however, has remained flat within the range of 54% to 56% over the last five years.<br/> <br/> •  In the general insurance and takaful sector, growth was supported by the fire business which offset the impact from slower growth in the motor and marine, aviation and transit business segments<br/> <br/> • The industry moved into the first phase of liberalisation of the motor and fire tariffs from 1 July 2016, where new motor and fire products may be offered at market-based prices while existing motor products under the tariff will continue to be available to the public at prevailing tariff rates. <br/> <br/> •  In the second phase which will commence on July 1, 2017, tariffs will be removed for all existing motor products except compulsory motor third party products where tariff rates will be gradually adjusted<br/> <br/> • By the end of 2017, more than three quarters of insurance and takaful policies for personal lines of business are expected to be simplified using plain language.<br/> <strong><br/> <strong>Islamic Finan</strong>c<strong>e Development</strong></strong><br/> <br/> • Islamic banking and takaful institutions remain resilient, maintaining healthy financial buffers. <br/> <br/> •  Investment intermediation activities saw encouraging growth: Investment accounts (IA) managed by Islamic banks increased to RM73.7bil to account for 12.2% of total Islamic deposits and IA within the Islamic banking system in 2016 (compared to RM47.1bil and 8.6% in 2015).<br/> <br/> • Over the next two years, the development of the Islamic finance industry will continue to focus on enabling greater business diversification, driven by technology, to sustain its growth trajectory and deliver better customer value. <br/> <br/> •  An example of this has been the operationalisation of the Investment Account Platform which has facilitated RM20mil of fund-raising exercises since April 2016 to support a variety of business ventures across different industries. <br/> <br/> •  Another important development priority is in the area of trade finance facilitation where the Bank aspires for syariah-compliant trade financing to support 10% of total trade in the next three years. <div><br/>   <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/109803B2-0719-4975-9081-C4AB2DE75BE9\" style=\"width: 620px;

      "                KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's economy expanded at 4.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016, exceeding  economists' survey of 4.4%, underpinned by the manufacturing and services sector, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) said.<br/> <br/> The central bank said on Thursday, the Q4, 2016 economic growth, as measured by the gross domestic product (GDP), was flat when compared to a year ago. <br/> <br/> However, for 2016, the GDP grew at a slower pace of 4.2% when compared with the 5% expansion in 2015.<br/> <br/> “On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the economy recorded a sustained growth of 1.4% (3Q 2016: 1.4%),” it said.<br/> <br/> The 4.5% growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the 4.2% expansion in 2016 were within the range projected by Treasury.<br/> <br/> BNM said going forward, the global economy was expected to improve but remain on a moderate growth path.  <p>“While there are indications of more sustained growth in the major economies in 2017, downside risks to global growth continue to prevail, arising from the volatility in commodity prices, policy uncertainties and growth prospects of the major developed economies, heightened risk aversions in the global financial markets as well as geopolitical developments,” it said. <br/> <br/> BNM said while the external environment might continue to remain challenging, the Malaysian economy will experience sustained growth with the primary driver being domestic demand. <br/> <br/> “Private consumption is anticipated to remain supported by wage and employment growth, with additional impetus coming from announced government measures to support disposable income of households.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/23D6FCE1-9251-4F8A-951F-817DF4CA3F08\" style=\"height: 446px; width: 620px;\"/></p> <p> “Investment activity will continue to be anchored by the on-going implementation of infrastructure projects and capital spending in the manufacturing and services sectors,” it said.<br/> <br/> Commenting on BNM said the Q4 2016 growth was supported by the continued expansion in private sector expenditure. <br/> <br/> On the supply side, growth continued to be driven by the manufacturing and services sectors. <br/> <br/> “Overall, domestic demand expanded at a more moderate pace, as the improvement in private consumption and investment activity was more than offset by the decline in public expenditure. <br/> <br/> In the fourth quarter, private consumption grew by 6.2% (3Q 2016: 6.4%), supported by continued wage and employment growth. <br/> <br/> “Private investment registered a growth of 4.9% (3Q 2016: 4.7%), following continued capital spending in the services and manufacturing sectors. Growth of public investment improved mainly on account of higher spending on fixed assets by public corporation, but nevertheless, remained in contraction during the quarter. <br/> <br/> “Public consumption also declined by 4.2% (3Q 2016: +2.2%) arising from the rationalisation of spending on supplies and services and a moderation in the growth of spending on emoluments. <br/> <br/> “On the external front, net exports contributed positively to growth as real exports expanded at a faster rate than real imports. <br/> <br/> “On the supply side, growth in the manufacturing, mining and agriculture sectors improved,” BNM said. <br/> <br/> In the Q4 2016, the manufacturing sector expanded at a faster pace at 4.8% owing to higher growth in both domestic and export-oriented industries. <br/> <br/> The mining sector recorded an improvement of 4.9% due to the increase of natural gas production during the quarter. <br/> <br/> In the agriculture sector, economic activity contracted at a slower pace at -2.4%, reflecting the diminishing impact of El Niño on crude palm oil yields. <br/> <br/> Growth in the services sector continued to expand at 5.5%, albeit at a more moderate pace, supported mainly by consumption-related services. <br/> <br/> In the construction sector, growth remained driven by the civil engineering sub-sector, recording a growth of 5.1%.<br/> <br/> BNM said that in Q4, 2016, the current account surplus widened, due mainly to a higher trade surplus and narrower deficits in the income accounts.<br/> <br/> The central bank said as at Jan 31, 2017, the reserves position totalled US$95bil (RM426bil). The international reserves remain ample to facilitate international transactions. They are sufficient to finance 8.6 months of retained imports, significantly higher than the 3-month international threshold.<br/> <br/> Total gross financing raised by the private sector through the banking system, development financial institutions (DFIs), and the capital market amounted to RM316.2bil (3Q 2016: RM293.8bil). <br/> <br/> On the ringgit, BNM said it depreciated by 7.6% against the US dollar during the quarter. <br/> <br/> The ringgit also depreciated against the euro (-1.6%), the pound sterling (-2.4%) and the Australian dollar (-2.5%), but appreciated against the Japanese yen (6.3%). <br/> <br/> The ringgit also depreciated against all regional currencies, with the exception of the Korean won, by between 2.1% and 5.6%.<br/> <br/> BNM said the Malaysian financial system remains resilient despite global uncertainties over policy adjustments in the major economies. <br/> <br/> The domestic banking system remains well-capitalised, with ample liquidity to support the financing needs of businesses and households. <br/> <br/> As businesses and households continue to adjust to the challenging economic outlook and higher cost of living, these financial buffers will support the resilience of the financial institutions. <br/> <br/> It cautioned that going forward, external events will continue to weigh heavily on the volatility of the domestic financial markets. <br/> <br/> BNM said these include increased uncertainty over political developments and growth in the major economies as well as volatile commodity prices. <br/> <br/> “Domestic financial system stability is nonetheless expected to be preserved given the loss absorption capacity of financial institutions supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers”, it added.<br/>  </p> <div><br/> </div>\r\n",

It was actually in perfect working condition, but I have to replace it because the bank has to upgrade the security features.</p><p>Banks are making billions in profit and we poor consumers have to pay for them to upgrade their security. This is what I feared when banks started to migrate customers away from human tellers to machines. Once customers become used to machines, we become easy targets for whatever fees the banks deem fit to charge. We cannot feasibly go back to human tellers.</p><p>What happens if banks have to train their tellers on new security features and procedures? Do customers have to pay for these upgrades as well? We are already paying RM1 per transaction on interbank ATM withdrawals and another 6sen in GST.</p><p>The banking unions had long ago predicted that bank mergers into bigger banks would make banking more expensive for consumers.</p><p>I was already mad that another bank last year suddenly charged me RM10 a month just to maintain my flexible home loan account. It said it was providing services such as monthly statements which I did not request and do not need. My total interest cost over the full loan is already more than the loan amount.</p><p>It is therefore timely that the Ombudsman for Financial Services (OFS) commenced operations on Oct 1. The OFS is approved by Bank Negara under the Financial Services Act 2013 and Islamic Financial Services Act 2013 to provide a fair and efficient avenue for financial consumers to resolve disputes against financial service providers.</p><p>The OFS serves as an independent redress mechanism with minimum formality for financial consumers. It aims to strengthen the financial consumer protection framework.</p><p>Financial consumers can refer eligible disputes involving banks, insurance companies, takaful operators, development financial institutions, designated payment instrument issuers, insurance and takaful brokers and financial advisers to the OFS for resolution. Disputes filed must not exceed RM250,000. I hope disputes on banking charges can be referred as well.</p><p>The services of the OFS are offered free of charge to financial consumers. Unlike the Malaysian Aviation Commission (Mavcom) which was mulling a plan to charge departing passengers a fee ranging between RM1 and RM2, so that we would be paying for what is basically a consumer watchdog.</p><p>Last year, 83 million passengers passed through airports operated by Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB) and if Mavcom imposes a RM1 charge it can earn RM83mil per year.</p><p>I am already paying a lot for passenger service charges (PSC), up to RM65 per flight, miscellaneous charges, ancillary charges for usage of airline services, insurance, food and even a fee for using a credit card when such usage actually saves the airline money.</p><p>I do not have to pay a fee every time I make a retail purchase to keep the consumer tribunal running, do I? Nor do I pay a fee every time I use my mobile phone to keep the multimedia commission running.</p><p>At this rate, very soon I may have to pay a charge to keep the police and the judicial system running! Isn’t our GST supposed to help pay for all this?</p><p>To rub salt into the wound, Mavcom had been studying the proposals by MAHB to raise the PSC. So I am paying a fee to an organisation that may approve an increase in the PSC?</p><p>I am also very worried that the Government is going to approve increasing the PSC. I really believe that the PSC should be reduced, not increased. Why? Have you seen what has become of our airports these days?</p><p>Airports are originally designed for the convenience and safety of air travellers and offer a facility to allow people to board and depart an aircraft.</p><p>They have been converted into shopping centres with most of the space taken up by shops, leaving precious little room for weary travellers to even sit down.</p><p>Don’t believe me? Try finding a seat in our airports that is not part of the food and beverage outlets that you have to patronise. They even removed a walkalator at KLIA to make way for more shops. KLIA2 is more <em>pasar malam</em> than airport terminal, with hardly any space for travellers to push their luggage. The Kuching airport is not better with broken floor tiles, dysfunctional escalators and dirty toilets.</p><p>Hello, I don’t have to pay a service charge to patronise the shopping malls in the country!

      "<p><strong>It is on rising trend, increasing 14% from three years ago</strong></p> <p>MENTION corporate fraud and most Malaysians will give a blank stare. An impromptu survey done by <em>StarBizWeek</em> in Kuala Lumpur’s central business district revealed the extent to which people know about corporate fraud. Of the 25 people, 23 did not know or did not want to comment.</p> <p>Experts say that corporate fraud is on the rise but that is difficult to ascertain since most research depends on survey respondents. Perhaps, the technology to detect such activities is better and the regulators have become more adept. But it is for sure that globalisation of economic activities and technology have also played a part in making fraudulent activities harder to detect or prosecute.</p> <p>Kroll Inc, the New York-based corporate investigations and risk consulting firm, says in a report that fraud is on an increasing trend, up 14% in its <em>Kroll Global Fraud Report 2015/2016</em>, from three years ago. The report noted that three-quarters of survey respondents were victims in the past year. The report also says that the number of companies weighed down in terms of financial loss arising from fraud has also increased to 69% last year, compared with 64% in 2014. </p> <p>An interesting observation among Malaysians is the equating of fraud with corruption. While its not exactly the same, there is often an element of corruption involved, as in people being paid off to turn the other way while fraudulent activity is being committed. Creative accounting is usually what comes to mind among people who have any opinion at all about corporate fraud. </p> <p>Vestra Solutions managing consultant and certified fraud examiner Gerald Pillai points out that developing countries such as Malaysia can see fraudulent activities rising, especially in economically challenging times while Baker Tilly Monteiro Heng corporate advisory partner Andrew Heng (<em>pic</em>) says corporate fraud is becoming more complex and has become increasingly difficult for auditors to detect. </p> <p>He adds that this is complicated by organisations forming shell companies abroad to create a semblance of legitimate business transactions. </p> <p>“You can create companies overseas and pretend to buy things from you on paper which could look normal, until you see the place and there is nothing there. </p> <p>“The level of detection and investigative work definitely will need to be increased, which will make it even harder for auditors to detect. It will not be something that you can instantly pick from the accounts,” Heng says.</p> <p>Obviously, any report on corporate fraud in Malaysia cannot ignore 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB), the controversial government-owned strategic investment firm. On July 20, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) announced a civil suit to seize more than US$1bil (RM4.02bil) in assets allegedly linked to 1MDB. </p> <p>Following the DOJ action, Deloitte Malaysia, 1MDB’s auditor, notified 1MDB of its intention to resign. Deloitte, referring to the suit, also noted that its audit reports for 1MDB’s financial statements for the financial years ended March 31, 2013 (FY13) and FY14 can no longer be relied upon because of information in the civil suit that were not available during those periods. 1MDB also sent out a statement saying that the audited financial statements for the periods concerned should no longer be relied on in light of the DOJ suit.</p> <p>Heng says the 1MDB case is not creative accounting per se but not having the right information on certain assets in certain companies that caused the auditors to withdraw their opinion. </p> <p>Referring to the 1MDB case, he says the role of auditors have become increasingly tougher and that there is need to give the client the benefit of doubt.</p> <p>However, in his experience, most corporate fraud involving listed companies here will have an element of creative accounting with the intention of manipulating the share price.</p> <p> The Transmile Group Bhd case from 2007 comes to mind. This case saw company officials abetting in making misleading statements relating to the airfreight company’s revenue in its unaudited consolidated results for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2006. Heng says there is sometimes, an element of money-laundering involved.</p> <p>Prominent fraud cases among listed companies in Malaysia in recent years include Kenmark Industrial Co (M) Bhd, Linear Corp Bhd and Axis Inc Bhd, all involving creative accounting. In Corporate Malaysia’s history, the Bumiputra Malaysia Finance Ltd (BMF) scandal of 1983 comes to mind as possibly the largest corporate scandal in the country then. </p> <p>The Hong Kong-based subsidiary of the-then Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd provided loans to several shady companies including units of Carrian Holdings Ltd, a conglomerate involved in property, finance and transportation.</p> <p> It involved the murder of a bank auditor and ultimately saw Hong Kong’s largest bankcruptcy with the collapse of Carrian. The Government also pumped in billions of ringgit to support Bank Bumiputra. </p> <p>Despite there being a royal commission of inquiry set up for this scandal, there were no prosecutions with BMF chairman Lorrain Esme Osman, living in exile until his death in London in 2011.</p> <p>Gerald says fraud needs to be prosecuted rigorously or it becomes part of the corporate culture. This sends a wrong message, he asserts.</p> <p>Given the number of prominent corporate scandals in the country in recent years, Gerald has this to say: “I think of late, we have this cover-up sort of attitude where we can always fix things and get away with it”.</p> <p>It is not to say that nothing is being done where fraud committed by listed companies is concerned. The Securities Commission in its annual report for 2015, shows that 74% of active investigations last year were devoted to insider trading, with the remainder for other misconducts such as corporate governance issues, fraud and market manipulation. </p> <p>However, experts say that there are still weaknesses in the active pursuit and prosecution of corporate fraud cases.</p> <p> They say that the laws are sufficient but enforcement is weak. </p> <p>The statutes that cover fraud and corruption in the country include the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009, the Penal Code, Development Financial Institutions Act 2002, Customs Act 1967 and the Election Offences Act 1954.</p> <p>“It probably comes down to enforcement whether relevant authorities understand these complications. </p> <p>“There is a corporate crime division in the police force and whether they want to beef up that division is important,” says Heng. </p> <p>Gerald stressed that the relevant authorities need to enforce the law without bias, only then can people consciously see that fraud is being taken seriously.</p> <p>Experts such as Heng say if bribery and corruption is lumped in with fraud, then the levels of fraud committed in Malaysia may be far higher.</p>\r\n",

      "                KUALA LUMPUR: On an annual basis, broad money (M3) growth moderated slightly to 1.9% in June compared with 2.2% in May, driven mainly by the continued extension of credit to the private sector by the banking system. <br/> <br/> In a statement, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) said the expansion, however, was partially offset by the continued issuance of equity by financial institutions and reclassification of Islamic Investment Accounts that took place in July 2015.<br/> <br/> M3 is measure of money supply. It comprises M1, namely money in circulation and cash deposits in banks, as well as M2 of plus time, savings and foreign currency deposits. <br/> <br/> Net financing to the private sector registered an annual growth of 6.9% in June versus 7.2% in May, due to the moderation in growth of loans extended by the banking system and development financial institutions.<br/> <br/> The growth in outstanding business loans of the banking system was lower at 4.2% during the month from 4.5% in May, mainly due to the lower loan growth in the manufacturing, education and wholesale and retail trade, and restaurants and hotel sectors. <br/> <br/> Outstanding loans to households grew at a slower pace of 6.0% for the month under review as compared with 6.2% in May, reflecting continued moderation across most types of loans.<br/> <br/> “Overall loan demand, however, increased during the month with a higher level of loan applications from both businesses and households,” BNM said.<br/> <br/> Meanwhile, the central bank said the banking system maintained strong capitalisation with the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio, Tier 1 Capital Ratio and Total Capital Ratio at 12.9%, 13.9% and 16.4%, respectively. <br/> <br/> Net impaired loans accounted for 1.3% of net loans, while loan loss coverage ratio stood at 89.5%.<br/> <br/> As at July 15, BNM’s international reserves amounted to RM390.8bil (equivalent to US$97.3bil), which is sufficient to finance 8.2 months of retained imports and is 1.2 times the short-term external debt. - Bernama<br/> <div><br/> </div>\r\n",

      "<p><strong>Venture capital and equity crowdfunding are gaining more acceptance among small businesses as credit gets tighter and word spreads on the upside to these alternative sources of funding, writes JOY LEE. </strong></p> <p>WITH credit expected to get tighter this year as the economy slows, more and more small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are warming up to the idea of alternative financing.</p> <p>Secretariat for the Advancement of Malaysian Entrepreneurs (SAME) CEO Neil Foo noted that the awareness level on alternative funds among SMEs was increasing, resulting in more companies looking into such options. </p> <p>Small businesses have generally been hesitant to explore alternative financing, such as those offered by venture capitalists (VCs), as they require business owners to give up a portion of their stakes in return for funds. </p> <p>According to investors, VCs are looking at holding a minimum of 30-40% stake in companies that they are investing in. </p> <p>Foo said most were also concerned that these new investors might interfere in the daily operations and management of their business. This was not necessarily the case, he pointed out.</p> <p>“Investors with minority equity will mainly act more as a mentor for SMEs,” he assured.</p> <p>“They would be able to advise on marketing strategies, systems and can offer SMEs access to their networks.</p> <p>“SMEs are more open these days to alternative financing such as VCs, and more small businesses are becoming aware of this concept with the dissemination of information through financial roadshows, our talk programmes, as well as SAME VC programme,” he added.</p> <p>DOERS Knowledge Management Group Sdn Bhd business development director Ken Choo concurred, noting that SMEs were no longer just looking for money but were also seeking strategic investors who would be able to add value to the business. The right investors would certainly give the company a boost. </p> <p>Notably, the Government has acknowledged the importance of developing alternative funding for small businesses. The revised Budget 2016 saw a RM6bil increase in funding to state-owed development financial institution and venture capital funds to provide financing specifically to SMEs and startup companies.</p> <p>Although VCs tend to prefer investing in startups with high growth potential, Foo said they were also looking into other business sectors. </p> <p>“VCs are interested in high PE (price-earning ratio) for ICT companies such as apps businesses. But now, VCs are also expanding to other areas such as F&amp;B companies which can multiply with chain shops. Even housing developments are being considered now,” said Foo.</p> <p>Alternatively, SMEs can opt to apply for loans with development financial institutions like SME Bank and Credit Guarantee Corp (CGC), and more recently, equity crowdfunding platforms.</p> <p>The main problem for most SMEs in obtaining funds, however, is the lack of a convincing business proposal, according to Foo. </p> <p>SAME recently organised a business proposal seminar to address the challenges faced by SMEs in generating good business proposals and offered possible solutions to resolve their financial constraints. </p> <p>Some 150 participants had the opportunity to learn writing skills and techniques to ensure minimal rate of rejection when applying for loans. </p> <p>The panellists for the seminar included former director of development banking and liaison for SME Bank Asbullah Adnan, SAME advisor and UniPacific Corporate Services executive director and CEO Peter Phang, Propellar Crowd+ chief operating officer Bryan Chung, and DOERS’s Choo.</p> <p>Asbullah noted that statistics showed only 7% of proposals for loan get through. Proposals are rejected mainly due to non-compliance with guidelines and what is perceived to be projects that are not viable, among other things.</p> <p>For equity crowdfunding, Chung said it was important that a business proposal was positioned to address a need in the market. </p> <p>“The power of the funds is in the hands of the crowd. As long as you can convince the crowd, you can get the funds. </p> <p>“Your proposal has to be concise with relevant information. It has to be something that strikes a chord and not just mere compliance and standards,” said Chung.</p>\r\n",

      "<p><span style=\"font-weight: lighter;\">THERE was much concern for the people and investors on how Malaysia can weather the storm arising from the continuous plunging crude oil price that hovers around US$30 per barrel currently as Budget 2016 was drawn up based on estimated oil price of US$45 per barrel.</span></p> <p>The pressing question raised is whether our government can deal with the mammoth challenge to source for other revenue streams and to cut the expenditure to sufficiently plug the oil revenue gap so as to stay on course in meeting the fiscal deficit and national debt targets of 3.1% and 55% limit of gross domestic product (GDP) respectively, failing which the country’s sovereign rating may be downgraded, resulting in a whole host of ramifications. </p> <p>It is a relief to know that the government is committed to attaining the fiscal targets set and I am pleasantly surprised this can be achieved largely by the RM9bil cut in the development and operating expenditure. </p> <p>The cut is laudable as the budget’s operating expenditure had already been reduced by RM8bil when Budget 2016 was first prepared compared with Budget 2015. </p> <p>It is comforting to see greater discipline in public spending; in the past the grouses were that only the rakyat were required to tighten their belts. </p> <p>It seems the revenue gap that needed to be filled is not as wide judging from the mere RM9bil cut on public expenditure. </p> <p>This could be due to the unexpectedly high goods and services tax (GST) collection of RM51bil since its implementation on April 1 2015, the original forecast for the entire 2016 was only RM39bil. </p> <p>We must acknowledge the introduction of GST is absolutely timely to cushion the adversity facing the Malaysian economy. </p> <p>The Government’s economic transformation programme which also include subsidy rationalisation, diversification to the service sector, has reduced the country’s dependence on oil revenue from more than 40% of total revenue to 20% currently. </p> <p>It is heartening to note the government did not implement any measures which required the rakyat to fork out more money through income tax and a high in the GST rate.</p> <p>Doubling the compliance and auditing efforts on tax evaders and restructuring the selling channels in duty-free islands to plug leakages are continuous actions to ensure unscrupulous businesses are taxed.</p> <p>Measures that were anticipated but did not materialise included the full withdrawal of Labuan duty free status, further roll-back of tax incentives and hike in stamp duty rate. </p> <p>It is likely that such moves were not implemented as the priority of the government was to maintain a conducive and accommodative business environment to sustain the economy. </p> <p>The government is also providing a special tax relief of RM2,000 for individual taxpayers whose monthly salary did not exceed RM8,000 which will benefit two million taxpayers and cost the government RM350mil. </p> <p>The 3% reduction for employees’ contribution to the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) will increase market liquidity and purchasing power of consumers.</p> <p>The EPF cut would add RM8bil in disposable income to the country’s 13.8 million workforce and if the money is spent as investment or expenditure within our economy, it would boost our GDP of RM1.2 trillion by about 0.65%. </p> <p>The education and tourism sectors will benefit from the additional RM5bil allocation for study loans and the arrival of Chinese tourists without visa respectively. </p> <p>SMEs and start-ups would also benefit from the RM6bil fund injected by the development financial institutions and government-owned venture capital funds. </p> <p>Other effective measures the government may consider moving forward include optimising the government sizeable workforce which stands at 1.6mil now. </p> <p>Most of the commercial organisations locally and globally are embarking on right-sizing exercises to optimise resources utilisation and enhance competitiveness. </p> <p>Ultimately for an economy to thrive, the nation’s resources should be fully optimised. Land disposal can be a major revenue stream. In the case of Singapore government, it reaped about S$14bil in 2015 from the sale of land. </p> <p>We may fully adopt the public auction process practised by the Singapore and Hong Kong Governments. </p> <p>Generally, people are encouraged by the better than anticipated state of affairs of our fiscal position as well as the bold measures introduced especially on the RM9bil expenditure cut while more measures can be introduced to further consolidate and stimulate our economy. </p> <p><strong>Yee Wing Peng is the Country Tax Leader of Deloitte Malaysia.

      "<p><strong>Malaysia restrategises to deal with current economic challenges</strong></p> <p>THIS is a repeat of what happened to last year’s national budget. </p> <p>With global crude oil prices sliding to new multi-year lows, Malaysia - which derives a major portion of its revenue from petroleum sources - has been forced to revise its Budget 2016 just three months after tabling it in Parliament. </p> <p>And similar to what took place around the same time last year, policymakers, politicians, bankers, economists, business leaders, consumer advocates and journalists, had congregated at the Putrajaya International Convention Centre (PICC) over the week to listen to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak’s special address on how the Government is going to revise its strategies to weather the current economic challenges faced by the country.</p> <p>Did the recalibration of Budget 2016 meet expectations?</p> <p>Well, going by the reactions of economic stakeholders so far, it appeared opinions range from fairly muted to slightly positive.</p> <p>AllianceDBS Research chief economist Manokaran Mottain, for one, thinks it is the right move, at the right time.</p> <p>“The Government’s revised macro targets and revision measures look realistic and pro-growth,” Manokaran explains, noting that the review of Budget 2016 appears targeted at two key macro headwinds facing the country, that is, depressed crude oil prices that have weighing on the Government’s fiscal position and subdued private consumption that could strain economic growth.</p> <p>CIMB Research economist Maslynnawati Ahmad concurs, saying: “We view the recent budget recalibration positively, as it tries to balance the need to tighten spending and still be able to act counter-cyclically to prevent a sharper economic slowdown.” </p> <p>“The government realistically assumes a bigger shortfall to incorporate the need for relief measures for rakyat to support growth and did not again, for second consecutive year, attempt to cut back development expenditure as significantly as it always did in the past whenever faced with an unexpected revenue shortfall or increase in spending,” she explains. </p> <p>A banker with a local financial institution, on the other hand, says: “There is no ho-hum about it; we are in a no-choice situation, as the economic outlook has become dimmer.” </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: lighter;\">“New targets and assumptions, along with fresh stimulus measures, have to be set to be more reflective of the present environment. Importantly, we have to be prepared, as we will likely see even tougher times ahead,” the banker, who wants to remain anonymous, tell </span><em style=\"font-weight: lighter;\">StarBizWeek </em><span style=\"font-weight: lighter;\">on the sidelines after Najib’s special address at the PICC.</span></p> <p><strong>Dimmer outlook</strong></p> <p>Indeed, there are red flags in the economic horizon. </p> <p>Depressed crude oil prices, aside, we are also looking at potentially slower global economic growth this year, while world trade remains sluggish. </p> <p>Domestically, reports about people facing job cuts and retrenchments in certain industries, and businesses experiencing drastic drop in sales, are increasing.</p> <p>Three months ago, the Government still thought Malaysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) had the potential to grow up to 5% in 2016. </p> <p>But now, as highlighted in the recalibrated Budget 2016, the Government thinks Malaysia’s economic growth will unlikely exceed 4.5% this year. </p> <p>The country’s GDP, nevertheless, is still expected to expand by at least 4% this year.</p> <p>“The best policy strategy now is to focus on growth,” Manokaran argues, applauding the Government’s initiatives to spur private consumption, which accounts for more than 53% of the country’s GDP.</p> <p>Under the recalibrated Budget 2016, the Government has introduced several measures aimed at boosting household disposable income and alleviate the rising cost of living to support private consumption growth. </p> <p>These include allowing employees’ contributions to the Employee Provident Fund to be reduced by 3% from March 2016 to December 2017; granting a tax relief of RM2,000 to individual taxpayers earning RM8,000 or less a month for the 2015 year of assessment; and various initiatives to reduce cost of food and essential goods.</p> <p>“The key to support domestic demand is to boost private consumption by putting money into the pockets of consumers,” Bank Negara governor Tan Sri Zeti Akhtar Aziz explains, adding that domestic demand is expected to remain as pillar of growth for Malaysia’s economy amid the soft external environment.</p> <p>On whether Bank Negara would cut interest rates to boost the domestic economy, Zeti says, the prevailing overnight policy rate of 3.25% remains accommodative enough to support growth.</p> <p>“What’s more important for the country’s economy now is liquidity, and that’s why we have reduced the statutory reserve requirement (SRR),” she explains.</p> <p>The SRR, which is a requirement imposed on commercial banks to ensure that a portion of their funds are placed with the central bank, will be reduced from 4% to 3.5%, with effect from Feb 1. </p> <p>This measure is expected to inject RM6.1bil of liquidity into the banking system.</p> <p><strong>Weak sentiment</strong></p> <p>MIDF Research, meanwhile, thinks that although some of the new measures under the revised Budget 2016 could help cushion the economic slowdown, they may not be able to stimulate stronger economic activity, due to the critically weak consumer and business sentiment.</p> <p>As it is, consumer confidence in Malaysia has already hit a new low, given the poor outlook on the job market and income growth, while cost of living continues to increase.</p> <p>According to the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research (Mier), the consumer sentiment index (CSI) plunged to a record low of 63.8 points in the fourth quarter of last year. </p> <p>Notably, the CSI has been hovering below the 100-point threshold, which demarcates between optimism and pessimism, since the fourth quarter of 2014. </p> <p>Local businesses are also quite pessimistic about the current economic situation. </p> <p>While there is slight improvement in their sentiment, business condition index remains in the negative territory at 87.1 points in the fourth quarter of 2015.</p> <p>Analysts point out that there are not many new measures to directly address the needs of the private sector. </p> <p>The only notable one is the RM6bil increase in allocations by development financial institutions and government venture capital funds to benefit start-up companies.</p> <p>However, they reckon that there are already sufficient existing measures to support the private sector. </p> <p>Furthermore, they note, the recalibrated Budget 2016 is not a new budget, but remains in line with the initiatives and allocation that had been proposed when the original version was unveiled last October.</p> <p><strong>Fiscal discipline</strong></p> <p>The recalibrated Budget 2016 is based on two base-case scenarios: one with Brent crude, which is the international oil benchmark, averaging at US$30 (RM124.50) per barrel; the other with Brent crude averaging at US$35 per barrel. </p> <p>This compares with the average oil-price assumption of US$48 per barrel used for the original Budget 2016.</p> <p>According to secretary-general of Treasury Tan Sri Mohd Irwan Serigar Abdullah, Malaysia can withstand sustained oil price decline to US$25 per barrel. </p> <p>As long as oil prices remain above that level, the country will be able to sustain its economic growth and the recalibrated Budget 2016 will remain. </p> <p>But if oil prices were to go any lower than US$25 per barrel, Irwan reckons that there will be great challenges, not only for Malaysia, but also for the global economy.</p> <p>Brent crude was traded at around US$34 per barrel yesterday. Last week, prices of the commodity fell to a 13-year low of around US$28 per barrel.</p> <p>In line with the depressed oil prices, the recalibrated Budget 2016 projects the Government’s revenue to decline by 3.5%-4.2% to RM216.3bil-RM217.9bil, compared with the originally estimated RM225.7bil, while its total spending (operating and development expenditure) will be cut by 3.0%-3.6% to RM255.7bil-RM257.2bil from the initially proposed RM265.2bil.</p> <p>“Cuts to operating expenditures are positive in the medium term, in our view, given the relative difficulty in trimming this spending,” Nomura Research says. </p> <p>“We are also not overly concerned by cuts in the development spending budget – as we have argued, while Malaysia’s public capex disbursement rates are high relative to the rest of the region, it is usually less than 100%, with an average development spending disbursement rate of 92% between 2011 and 2014,” it adds.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Manokaran says, while the Government has been relatively silent on the specific operating and development expenditure it is targeting to slash, the commitment to achieve the 3.1% fiscal-deficit-to-GDP target should augur well for the country’s sovereign rating standings.</p> <p>“We believe that the credit rating agencies would be content to see this commitment,” he says. </p> <p>Looking ahead, though, Manokaran reckons that the fiscal challenge of balancing the budget by 2020 remains. </p> <p>“The Government will have to keep future budgets lean as the depressed crude oil price level could remain for a while,” he explains.</p>\r\n",

      "                KUALA LUMPUR: Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak delivered a revised Budget 2016 at Putrajaya International Convention Centre.<br/> <br/> Here is the full text of his speech:<br/> <br/> Ladies and Gentlemen,<br/> <br/> <strong>I. Introduction</strong><br/> <br/> 1. Alhamdulillahi Rabbil A'lamin wa biHi nastain. Blessings and peace be upon Prophet Muhammad SAW.<br/> <br/> 2. I begin by reciting the translation by the ulama with reference to the words of Allah Ta'ala in Surah Al-Insyirah that with each difficulty surely there is ease or happiness.<br/> <br/> 3. We should place such confidence in ourselves as well as in the administration and management of the Government.<br/> <br/> 4. As the old Malay saying goes, the coast changes with the tide. Thus, I wish to make a special address today as the 2016 Budget is also subject to challenges in the global economic environment.<br/> <br/> 5. Today, I wish to highlight and share with you an explanation, comparison and clarification as well as measures undertaken to address various challenges that the nation has and is experiencing for the last two decades.<br/> <br/> 6. We are grateful to Allah SWT for among those present today are leaders and administrators, civil servants, captains of industry, corporate figures, representatives from foreign missions, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and volunteers.<br/> <br/> 7. All are here today for this special address to understand the Government's action in recalibrating and restructuring several economic measures, particularly with regard to the 2016 Budget.<br/> <br/> 8. Of importance, the recalibration and restructuring of the Budget are centred on two main pillars. First, to ensure the economy remains on a strong growth trajectory, and second, to protect and safeguard the welfare and well-being of the rakyat.<br/> <br/> 9. In tandem with the People First concept, the measures that I will announce soon is a comprehensive summary after taking into account ideas and views that I have received.<br/> <br/> 10. This was complemented by several engagement sessions with various economic stakeholders including Government-linked companies (GLCs), economists as well as industry experts.<br/> <br/> 11. The Government has also received excellent ideas from various levels of NGOs, representing consumers, esteemed businessmen and directors of commercial banks.<br/> <br/> 12. The majority of them are here with us this afternoon. Thank you for your input.<br/> <br/> Indeed, we are all doing this together for our nation.<br/> <br/> <strong>II. Comparison of the Economic Scenario Since 1997/1998</strong><br/> <br/> 13. First, let us reflect on the economic scenario during the Asian financial crisis from 1997 to 1998.<br/> <br/> 14. In 1997/1998, the country experienced an economic recession with GDP recording a negative growth of 7.4%.<br/> <br/> 15. We should not forget that among the significant effects of the recession were the sharp retrenchments; increase in inflation; reduction in international reserves to RM59 billion; and the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) index plummeting to reach 260-point level.<br/> <br/> 16. Many companies went bust. Furthermore, some of our children including Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) school leavers and young graduates had their dreams and aspirations to continue their studies abroad crushed as the Government then could not afford to finance them.<br/> <br/> 17. Given the situation, the leadership of the Government then took drastic measures including implementing capital controls and currency pegging the ringgit at 3.80 to the US dollar.<br/> <br/> 18. Banking institutions were rationalised and private sector loans were restructured through the establishment of Danaharta and Danamodal. The Government also implemented a stimulus package of RM7 billion to revive the domestic economy.<br/> <br/> 19. The nation again faced an economic recession in 2008/2009 due to the subprime crisis in the US which impacted the global economy as well as the steep increase in global crude oil prices reaching USD130 per barrel compared with an average of USD70 per barrel in 2007.<br/> <br/> 20. The country's exports declined by more than 15%. This affected consumer and business sentiments.<br/> <br/> 21. During that time, I had just been appointed as the Minister of Finance and without hesitation took immediate measures by announcing the first economic stimulus package amounting to RM7 billion in November 2008.<br/> <br/> 22. A few months later, a second stimulus package of RM60 billion was undertaken in March 2009 to continue to stimulate domestic economic activity. The second stimulus package also involved initiatives and collaboration between the Government and the private sector.<br/> <br/> 23. In addition to the stimulus packages, upon assuming the nation's leadership and until today, the Government planned and implemented several initiatives under the National Transformation Policy (NTP).<br/> <br/> 24. The Government launched the Government Transformation Programme (GTP) and the Economic Transformation Programme (ETP) to elevate Malaysia to a developed and high-income country by 2020.<br/> <br/> 25. Among the achievements of the transformation include strong GDP growth averaging 5.6%; reduction in Government fiscal deficit from 6.7% to 3.2% as well as manageable inflation rate.<br/> <br/> 26. We are grateful that hardcore poverty has almost been eradicated. In addition, 1.8 million job opportunities were created and rakyat 1Malaysia initiatives and programmes were introduced such as 1Malaysia People Assistance (Bantuan Rakyat 1Malaysia or BR1M), 1Malaysia Book Voucher (Baucar Buku 1Malaysia or BB1M), Kedai Rakyat 1Malaysia (KR1M), Klinik 1Malaysia and affordable housing.<br/> <br/> 27. Life is not always smooth sailing. Looking back at the scenario in 2015, Malaysia faced several daunting challenges that were unexpected and beyond our control.<br/> <br/> 28. Crude oil prices declined from USD100 in 2014 to USD48 per barrel in 2015. Crude oil prices have since continued to fall resulting in the recalibration of the 2015 Budget.<br/> <br/> 29. Last year, the country's oil-related revenue fell by almost RM14 billion. Thus, on 20 January 2015, on behalf of the Government, I presented the recalibration of the 2015 Budget by rationalising government expenditure as well as revising the fiscal deficit target from 3% to 3.2% to GDP.<br/> <br/> 30. I would like to emphasise that the recalibration of the 2015 Budget was supported by initiatives such as the rationalisation of fuel subsidy which was implemented earlier although it was an unpopular decision.<br/> <br/> 31. All praise is due to Allah, these measures have been successful in mitigating the impact from declining oil prices and global economic uncertainties.<br/> <br/> 32. Indeed, international rating agencies such as Moody's, Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch remain confident in the nation's strong economic fundamentals and financial position by maintaining a good credit rating.<br/> <br/> 33. Based on these factors, I am confident that the economy will record a growth of 5% and the fiscal deficit at 3.2% of GDP as targeted for 2015. The GDP growth for 2015 will be announced next month.<br/> <br/> <strong>III. Latest Economic Scenario</strong><br/> <br/> 34. The global economy is expected to be more challenging in 2016. The latest data by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) indicates that the global economy will grow at a slower pace from 3.6% to 3.4%.<br/> <br/> 35. Meanwhile, world trade is anticipated to moderate from 4.1% to 3.4%. This is on account of several economies such as South Africa, the US, Brazil and China which are also expected to grow at a slower pace.<br/> <br/> 36. This trend proves that we are not alone in facing the global economic challenges. Other countries too are affected by the current economic uncertainties.<br/> <br/> 37. World crude oil prices have continued to plummet below USD30 per barrel. As of yesterday, Dated Brent crude oil prices dropped to USD31 per barrel, a reduction of 35% compared to the assumption of USD48 during the tabling of the 2016 Budget.<br/> <br/> 38. These developments have a significant effect on the nation's revenue. The economy of oil producing countries has also been adversely affected.<br/> <br/> 39. Furthermore, the US dollar continues to strengthen compared to other currencies. Among the currencies affected are the Brazil real (-23.2%), China renminbi (-5.7%), Canadian dollar (-11.3%), Russian ruble (-29.3%), and Singapore dollar (-5.6%).<br/> <br/> 40. Meanwhile, the ringgit too has depreciated by 11.3% against the US dollar from 3.77 in June 2015 to 4.25 on 27 January 2016.<br/> <br/> 41. In fact, the ringgit is undervalued and does not reflect the true economic fundamentals. However, the ringgit is expected to better reflect the strength of the economic fundamentals when global financial markets stabilise and oil prices recover to more reasonable levels.<br/> <br/> <strong>IV. New Measures</strong><br/> <br/> 42. These developments have increased uncertainties in the global economy and impacted the domestic economy as well as resulted in the rising cost of living of the rakyat.<br/> <br/> 43. Recognising this, and as a responsible Head of the Government together with the Deputy Prime Minister and Cabinet Ministers, today, we are taking proactive action to announce the implementation of measures under the recalibrated 2016 Budget.<br/> <br/> 44. These initiatives are very important to ensure sustainable economic growth, and more importantly, to safeguard the wellbeing of the rakyat. I am confident that together we can overcome these difficult challenges again.<br/> <br/> We have done it before, God willing, we can do it again.<br/> <br/> 45. Similar to the situation last year, I wish to reiterate that the nation is neither in economic nor technical recession.<br/> <br/> 46. In fact, with our efforts and prayers, the domestic economy continues to remain strong and resilient, capable of facing global economic uncertainties.<br/> <br/> 47. In addition to the measures in the 2016 Budget, I am pleased to announce 11 restructured and recalibrated measures to ensure the economy and financial position remain on the right trajectory.<br/> <br/> 48. Measure 1: The Government agrees to reduce the employees' contribution to the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) by 3% beginning March 2016 to December 2017. However, the contribution by employers will remain. This measure is expected to increase private consumption expenditure by RM8 billion a year.<br/> <br/> 49. Measure 2: The Government will provide a special tax relief of RM2,000 to individual taxpayers with a monthly income of RM8,000 or below for the year of assessment 2015.<br/> <br/> Through this measure, although the Government will forego revenue of RM350 million, it will provide individual tax savings of up to RM475 which will benefit two million taxpayers.<br/> <br/> 50. Measure 3: To reduce the cost of daily basic necessities for the rakyat, the Government will implement the following:<br/> <br/> i. The Government will liberalise the control on import quotas or Approved Permits (APs) on eight agricultural produce for a temporary period to ensure consistent supply.<br/> <br/> The produce includes raw coffee beans, buffalo meat, beef and mutton. At the same time, quality and safety requirements on imported goods will continue to be given priority;<br/> <br/> ii. Federal Agricultural Marketing Authority (FAMA) will establish markets or MyFarm Outlets that sell agricultural produce directly such as fish, poultry, meat, vegetables and fruits at prices between 5% and 20% below market prices. For a start, the first outlet will be opened in Precinct 7, Putrajaya in March and expanded nationwide to 10 other locations in town centres this year;<br/> <br/> iii. To ensure that the rakyat enjoy fair prices of goods, I have directed the Ministry of Domestic Trade, Co-operatives and Consumerism (MDTCC) to identify more fair price shops including foreign and local hypermarkets. Thus, fair price shops will be increased from 640 to 1,000 shops this year;<br/> <br/> iv. At the same time, MDTCC will step up enforcement and take legal action on non-ethical businessmen who take the opportunity of profiteering;<br/> <br/> v. To safeguard the paddy farmers as well as to increase paddy production, the Government will provide an additional cash of RM50 for every metric tonne of cleaned paddy as an input incentive for paddy production. At the same time, the Government will improve the implementation of paddy grading through a standard grading system; and<br/> <br/> vi. The Government is very concerned for the rakyat who are affected by the increase in the cost of living, particularly the hardcore poor. Thus, MyBeras programme will be introduced where every registered hardcore poor household will be supplied with 20 kilogrammes of rice every month until December 2016 to reduce the burden of poor households.<br/> <br/> 51. Measure 4: With immediate effect, for all new housing projects, the Government mandates that all houses priced up to RM300,000 be limited to first-time house buyers only.<br/> <br/> The Government will also organise Integrated House Ownership Expo Roadshows which offer houses under the National Housing Department (JPN), 1Malaysia People Housing Programme (PR1MA), Syarikat Perumahan Negara Berhad (SPNB), Perumahan Penjawat Awam 1Malaysia (PPA1M) and state agencies as well as the private sector. More than 100,000 housing units will be offered under the programme.<br/> <br/> In addition, for houses priced at RM35,000 under the People's Housing Programme (Projek Perumahan Rakyat or PPR), I am pleased to announce that the Government through Bank Simpanan Nasional (BSN) and Bank Rakyat will offer a financing package at 4% involving a fund totalling RM400 million. This initiative will benefit more than 10,000 house owners.<br/> <br/> 52. Measure 5: As announced in the 2016 Budget, 30% from the levy contribution to the Human Resources Development Fund (HRDF) amounting to RM200 million will be provided to enhance the competency and skills of employees through reskilling and upskilling, including retrenched workers.<br/> <br/> 53. Measure 6: To enhance the efficiency and amount of tax collection, the following measures will be implemented:<br/> <br/> i. The Government will double compliance and auditing efforts on tax evaders;<br/> <br/> ii. The Government to give special consideration on relaxation for penalty on taxpayers to encourage them to come forward and declare their past years' income. The tax arrears must be settled before 31 December 2016;<br/> <br/> iii. For duty-free islands, to reduce leakages which resulted in revenue loss of nearly RM1 billion, the Government will restructure the selling channel of cigarettes and liquors limited to duty-free outlets licensed by the Royal Malaysian Customs Department (RMCD);<br/> <br/> iv. The free duty treatment on imported vehicles in duty-free islands will be tightened.<br/> <br/> However, the restructuring of sales on cigarettes, liquors and vehicles will not affect the tourists and locals who are residing in these duty-free islands;<br/> <br/> v. The Government will optimise the revenue from the telecommunication spectrum through a redistribution and bidding process which will be implemented soon; and<br/> <br/> vi. To invigorate economic activity, the Government will develop several strategic areas owned by the Government through a bidding process.<br/> <br/> 54. Measure 7: Under the initiative of the Deputy Prime Minister, as the Chair of the Foreign Workers Committee, the Government will streamline the management of the foreign workers system whereby the levy will be clustered into two categories only. This does not include the foreign domestic maid category.<br/> <br/> In addition, the Government has agreed to implement the Rehiring Programme to provide opportunities for Foreign Workers Without Permits (PATI) in the country to be given valid work permits. The implementation of this programme is to fulfil industry demand as well as to enable the Government to ascertain the number of PATI in the country for the purpose of security monitoring.<br/> <br/> 55. Measure 8: The Government will be more prudent in spending, particularly on supplies and services; continue efforts to rationalise the provision of grants to Government Trust Funds, federal statutory bodies and GLCs; as well as rationalise and restructure entities, including Companies Limited By Guarantee (CLBG) and statutory bodies.<br/> <br/> 56. Measure 9: With regard to development expenditure, focus will be given to projects and programmes that are rakyat-centric, as well as with high multiplier effect and low import content.<br/> <br/> Physical projects that will be prioritised include construction of affordable houses, hospitals, schools, roads and public transport as well as security. The implementation of non-physical projects and projects that are still under study will be rescheduled. This measure is expected to involve a reduction in cash flow commitments up to RM5 billion and does not affect the economy and the rakyat.<br/> <br/> 57. Measure 10: Development financial institutions (DFIs) and Government-owned venture capital funds (VCs) will increase their financing funds by RM6 billion to provide financing to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and startup companies.<br/> <br/> 58. Measure 11: I urge the GLCs to implement the initiative to narrow the income gap between higher management and employees gradually. The private sector is also urged to implement the same initiative. This will be monitored by the Economic Planning Unit (EPU).<br/> <br/> 59. More focus will be given to the tourism sector as the increase in tourist arrivals will stimulate domestic economic growth, particularly in the current economic scenario. The promotion of domestic tourism will be intensified through organising sales of integrated domestic holiday packages.<br/> <br/> 60. In addition, the Government will facilitate the entry of foreign tourists by expediting the implementation of eVisa to several countries which have been identified.<br/> <br/> 61. As an additional measure, I am pleased to announce that tourists from China do not require a visa to visit Malaysia or Visa Free, commencing from 1 March to 31 December 2016, subject to specific conditions for a period of stay not exceeding 15 days.<br/> <br/> 62. Although the global economic situation and the decline in crude oil prices have an impact on the nation's revenue which is estimated to fall by RM7 to RM9 billion compared to the estimated revenue with crude oil price at USD48 per barrel, the Government will not compromise on doing the right thing for the nation and the rakyat.<br/> <br/> 63. BR1M and welfare assistance programmes will continue to be implemented. I would also like to emphasise that the Government will maintain the current rate of the Goods and Services Tax (GST).<br/> <br/> 64. The Government will continue to spend prudently by prioritising projects and programmes with high impact centred on the philosophy of the people economy.<br/> <br/> 65. This will not involve the emoluments of civil servants and pensions of retirees as well as not affect the delivery mechanism of the Government. In fact, the Government will not terminate the services of any civil servants, including those appointed on contract basis.<br/> <br/> Furthermore, the Government will continue the implementation of one annual increment for civil servants on 1 July 2016, as promised in the 2016 Budget.<br/> <br/> 66. These prudent measures are expected to save RM9 billion in operating expenditure and development expenditure.<br/> <br/> 67. Regardless of what happens, the Government assures it is committed in the education and future of our children. In this regard, the Government agrees to continue four programmes under the sponsorship of the Public Service Department (PSD) for 2016 as follows:<br/> <br/> First, the National Scholarship Programme for 20 top SPM students to pursue study at renowned universities globally.<br/> <br/> Second, the Special Engineering Programme for 200 students to Japan, Korea, Germany and France.<br/> <br/> Third, the Bursary Graduate Programme for 744 students to pursue undergraduate studies in public universities and private institutions of higher learning in the country; and<br/> <br/> Fourth, the new intake of 8,000 students will be awarded scholarships to pursue undergraduate studies in the country.<br/> <br/> 68. Furthermore, the allocation for the National Higher Education Fund (PTPTN) financing totalling RM5 billion will continue to be channelled to undergraduates.<br/> <br/> 69. To intensify investment in human capital, the MyBrain15, Academic Training Scheme for Bumiputera (SLAB) and Academic Training Scheme of Public Higher Education Institutions (SLAI) programmes will be continued.<br/> <br/> 70. Currently, 25,000 students are pursuing studies under these programmes. The Government has agreed to the increase of 15,000 new students for the MyMaster programme, 5,000 for MyPhD, and 300 for SLAI. These programmes will be given an additional allocation of RM300 million.<br/> <br/> 71. I wish to emphasise that:<br/> <br/> First: After taking into consideration the current economic scenario, the Government has decided to revise the 2016 forecast of GDP growth to 4% – 4.5% and the assumption for average Dated Brent crude oil price at USD30 to 35 per barrel;<br/> <br/> Second: The Government is committed to fiscal consolidation measures for 2016, that is, to achieve a fiscal deficit target of 3.1% to GDP;<br/> <br/> Third: The national debt level will continue to be reduced and will not exceed the prudent level of 55% to GDP;<br/> <br/> Fourth: The Government will neither impose capital control nor peg the ringgit;<br/> <br/> Fifth: Maintain an accommodative monetary policy and interest rate at a level that supports domestic economic activity; and<br/> <br/> Sixth: Ensure sufficient liquidity in the financial system. Recently, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) announced a reduction in statutory reserve requirement (SRR) from 4% to 3.5%.<br/> <br/> 72. Clearly, the Government will not waiver from its stance on fiscal and monetary policies to ensure the strength of the economy.<br/> <br/> 73. The Government is also concerned over the lifestyle of the rakyat who live beyond their means. In this regard, the Credit Counselling and Debt Management Agency (AKPK) under BNM will assist borrowers with difficulties in managing their debt obligations through restructuring their existing loans. The good news is that all these services are provided free.<br/> <br/> 74. For viable SMEs and companies that face financial problems due to the current environment, the Government provides a negotiation mechanism through the Small Debt Resolution Scheme and the Corporate Debt Restructuring Committee under BNM.<br/> <br/> 75. In terms of investment, I wish to emphasise that the Government remains committed to achieving the targeted private investment totalling RM215 billion this year.<br/> <br/> 76. For example, the implementation of major projects such as Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) and Light Railway Transit (LRT), Pan-Borneo Highway, Malaysian Vision Valley, Cyber City Centre, RAPID Pengerang and High-Speed Rail will be continued.<br/> <br/> 77. To enhance strategic linkages between urban and rural areas, the Government will build another 10 Urban Transformation Centres (UTCs) in Labuan, Sungai Petani, Miri, Sibu, Kota Bharu, Kuala Terengganu, Tawau, Keningau, Seremban and Kangar.<br/> <br/> 78. In addition, four new Rural Transformation Centres (RTCs) are expected to be completed this year in Jawi, Pulau Pinang; Rembau, Negeri Sembilan; Sungai Rambai, Melaka; and Betong, Sarawak.<br/> <br/> 79. To penetrate international markets, MATRADE and SME Corp will intensify the mid-tier and Go-Export programmes. In addition, to enhance the credit guarantee facility for trade, EXIM Bank will increase its funds for financing by RM500 million.<br/> <br/> 80. As a trading nation with an open economy, the Government will expand exports to other markets. We have to explore new markets through participation in free trade agreements (FTAs) such as the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA) as well as the upcoming Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).<br/> <br/> 81. With regard to the TPPA which was passed by Dewan Rakyat late yesterday, the allegation by some quarters that we have compromised national sovereignty and were apologetic in defending the Bumiputera agenda during the negotiations with TPPA members were unfounded.<br/> <br/> 82. It is noteworthy that the Government's efforts and firmness during the negotiation process with the members of the TPPA have resulted in the acceptance of the Bumiputera policy as part of the terms of the Agreement at the international level.<br/> <br/> 83. Thus the Bumiputera Agenda is no longer a national agenda, but has now been elevated and recognised globally.<br/> <br/> <strong>V. Conclusion</strong><br/> <br/> 84. An advanced nation is not solely due to good and appropriate policies but also the contribution from all segments of society.<br/> <br/> 85. We all have a shared responsibility irrespective of the private sector, Government, NGO, youth and women, and regardless of whether one is a chief executive officer, director, support staff, worker or a small sundry shop owner.<br/> <br/> 86. Overall, the five key salient points are summarised as follows:<br/> <br/> First: The recalibrated measures announced are proactive, transparent and realistic in tandem with the current global economic challenges;<br/> <br/> Second: The economy remains resilient and continues to expand driven by domestic economic activity;<br/> <br/> Third: The wellbeing of the rakyat will continue to be prioritised and Government service delivery will not be compromised;<br/> <br/> Fourth: The Government is committed to implementing the fiscal consolidation measures; and<br/> <br/> Fifth: The recalibration of the budget is centred on the principle of shared responsibility from all segments of society.<br/> <br/> 87. In brief, the restructuring and recalibration of the 2016 Budget is similar to last year. It is not a new budget. It is within the range of initiatives and allocation of the 2016 Budget approved by Parliament.<br/> <br/> 88. It is clear that matters related to the nation's economy and finance is not easy to digest and understood by all levels.<br/> <br/> 89. In fact, these issues are not solely the responsibility of the nation's administration at the highest level.<br/> <br/> 90. Borrowing the words of wisdom from the learned ones, in life and livelihood, in a country with a government, everyone must play his part, helping each other through thick and thin. That is our source of strength.<br/> <br/> 91. Hence, I hope that every segment plays its part in explaining the current economic situation and initiatives of the Government to further strengthen the economy as well as safeguard the wellbeing of the rakyat.<br/> <br/> 92. This means that all groups from the Government administration to the learned ones need to explain in greater detail the current situation and challenges to all parties from top to bottom, engaging in discussions in mamak stalls over teh tarik to the best of their abilities.<br/> <br/> 93. With that, we hope our great grandchildren will recognise all our achievements for Malaysia's continuity which is not our right but the right of the future generation.<br/> <br/> 94. We hold to the saying of the elders: it is better to be silent rather than speak empty words and to give voice to useful matters. Do not ask what the nation has done for you but ask what we have done for the nation.<br/> <br/> 95. In essence, the challenges confronting us currently are not due to the failure of the Government to plan, but are on account of the global economic crisis which is beyond our control.<br/> <br/> 96. Indeed, every decision that we make today is the best for the rakyat and will surely be recorded in history. Furthermore, Malaysia is neither a failed state nor a bankrupt nation as alleged.<br/> <br/> 97. In fact, the reality is the economy is stable with strong growth as well as resilient and competitive.<br/> <br/> 98. Let us together pray to the Almighty to overcome all problems and enjoy security, peace and harmony.<br/> <br/> Thank you.\r\n",

      "<p>PETALING JAYA: Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak <strong>(pic)</strong> has announced a revised Budget 2016 to optimise the country's developmental and operational expenditures in the face of slower economic growth.</p> <p>The revised budget will include precautionary and proactive measures in managing national revenue and expenditures, while ensuring that the well-being of the people remained a priority.</p> <p>Najib said the recalibration is necessary due to a slump in global oil prices and a slower economic growth in the United States and China.</p> <p>When Budget 2016 was unveiled in Parliament last October, the crude oil price was at US$48 (RM203) per barrel.</p> <p>However, the current price per barrel stands at US$30 (RM127), a sharp fall since the Budget was presented.</p> <p><strong>Highlights</strong></p> <p>- The 2016 global economy expected to be more challenging and economic growth expected to fall from 3.6% to 3.4%.</p> <p>- Malaysia not alone in facing global economic challenges. Current crude oil price stands at US$31 (RM131) per barrel.</p> <p>- Latest developments indicate that the global economy is at a very volatile stage and requires a proactive move to revise Budget 2016.</p> <p>- We are not in a recession, neither are we in a technical recession.</p> <p>- Eleven recalibrated measures announced.</p> <p>- 1. EPF contributions by employees to be reduced by 3%. This is expected to increase private sector spending by RM8bil.</p> <p>- 2. Tax relief of up to RM2,000 to those with income RM8,000 a month or lower. Two million taxpayers to benefit.</p> <p>- 3. To reduce cost of living, Govt to liberalise APs for agricultural products including coffee beans and meats.</p> <p>- 4.

MyBeras programme to be introduced until Dec 2016. Each hardcore poor family will be given 20kg of rice every month.</p> <p>- 7. The Government will update the management system of foreign workers, with levies clustered into two categories, not including foreign maids.</p> <p>- 8. Government will exercise prudent spending on supplies and services and to continue with grant rationalisation.</p> <p>- 9. Development budget to focus on projects and programmes that place the people first, have high multiplier effect and reduce imports.</p> <p>- 10. Development financial institutions and Government venture capital funds to increase allocations by RM6bil for benefit of start-ups and SMEs.</p> <p>- 11. GLCs urged to implement initiatives to reduce the income gap between senior management and workers, to be monitored by the Economic Planning Unit.</p> <p>Najib said Thursday's recalibrated budget was based on the approach of \"shared responsibility\" by certain segments of society.</p> <p>He said lower-income groups will not be affected, and continue to benefit from measures such as the 1Malaysia People's Aid (BR1M).</p> <p>\"The present rate of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) will also be retained at 6%. The Government has no plans to increase this,\" said Najib at the Putrajaya International Convention Centre (PICC).</p> <p>He also said that Malaysia would not resort to imposing capital controls and pegging the Ringgit, such as was done during the 1997-1998 financial crisis.</p> <p>\"The Government remains committed to maintaining the fiscal consolidation measures for 2016, which is to achieve a GDP target of 3.1%.</p> <p>\"Our country's debt will be reduced and will not exceed 55% of the GDP. The Government also has no plans to impose capital controls and peg the Ringgit,\" he said.</p> <p>Najib also made mention of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA), which had been debated at a special Parliamentary sitting on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p> <p>He provided assurances that with the signing of the free trade agreement, there would be no compromise on the country's sovereignty.</p> <p>\"The Bumiputera agenda remains intact. In fact, it is no longer a national agenda. With the TPPA, it has reached a global scale,\" he added.</p>\r\n",

      "                KUALA LUMPUR: Credit Guarantee Corp Malaysia Bhd (CGC) and the Business Development Fund (BDF) of Rwanda has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to collaborate on the development of credit guarantee framework for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Rwanda. <br/> <br/> With the signing of the MoU, CGC shall offer assistance and guidance to BDF to develop, design and review the credit guarantee framework to support the development of SMEs in Rwanda. <br/> <br/> CGC will also be providing technical assistance in the development of the credit guarantee schemes, policy guidelines and other operational matters, it said in a statement issued following the signing ceremony in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday. <br/> <br/> CGC president and chief executive officer Mohd Zamree Mohd Ishak said the collaboration between CGC and BDF would enable CGC to share its 43 years of experience and expertise in SME financing and overall SME development in Rwanda.<br/> <br/> Mohd Zamree said that the collaboration would also enable CGC to share and transfer its knowledge and experience to BDF through on-the-job trainings, research, publications and study visits. <br/> <br/> CGC regularly host study visits for the development financial institutions from Asia, the Middle East and Africa. <br/> <br/> In 2015, CGC hosted study visits from the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI) that had 41 delegates from 33 countries and also delegations from Bangladesh, Egypt, Japan and South Korea. <br/> <br/> “Many developing countries that do not have credit guarantee institutions are observing CGC as a model and success story and want to emulate it in introducing the guarantee mechanism in their respective countries. <br/> <br/> “This is not just an acknowledgement of CGC’s expertise but also of Malaysia’s capabilities in SME development,” Mohd Zamree said. <br/> <br/> CGC has been at the forefront of SME development not only in Malaysia but also at international level, assisting countries such as Papua New Guinea, Mongolia, Timor Leste and other countries in the Middle East and Africa. <br/> <br/> “Rwanda and Malaysia share a long and warm friendship. Today, we are taking another step to further strengthen the relations. The MOU marks a milestone in formalising a partnership not only between BDF and CGC, but also between both countries,” BDF Rwanda chief executive officer Innocent Bulindi said. <br/> <br/> “The Government of Rwanda has recently enhanced BDFs mandate to support SMEs. In this regard, BDF is undergoing a transformation to strengthen its capacities, especially in developing the right skill set and expertise to deliver its new mandate. <br/> <br/> “It is indeed an honour for BDF to have the opportunity to learn from CGC’s experiences, strategies and successes which have been accumulated over time in such a high calibre institution,” he said. <br/> <br/> Since its inception in 1972, CGC has given financing to SMEs valued over RM56bil, benefitting about 315,000 SMEs. - Bernama<br/> <div><br/> </div>\r\n",

      "<p><strong>Lim Wing Hooi reports on a forum to educate SMEs about the ins and outs of applying for bank loans.</strong></p> <p>ACCESS TO financing has always been vital for the smooth running of companies and the economy. </p> <p>With that in mind, the Secretariat for the Advancement of Malaysian Entrepreneurs (SAME) organised a closed-door forum to discuss how to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) prepare themselves before knocking on the banker’s door.</p> <p>As part of its effort to help Malaysian SMEs, SAME organises such forums to educate SMEs about the issues they face.</p> <p>The eighth forum, titled “Winning bank loans with a business plan”, was moderated by SAME chief executive officer Neil Foo at the organisation’s office in Menara Usahawan, Putrajaya on May 27.</p> <p>Teoh Eng Tat, entrepreneur development manager for the Centre for Entrepreneur Development and Research (Cedar) and one of two panelists present at the forum, explained the fundamentals of credit assessment.</p> <p>Teoh elaborated on the 5Cs of credit assessment: Character of the borrower, the Capacity of the business to generate funds to repay, the initial Capital that the entrepeneur put at risk, the current Condition involving the operating business environment and lastly, the Collateral offered to the bank.</p> <p>“This is the typical criterias that bankers look at. For new companies, a business plan that (addresses all these factors) is deemed bankable and bankers will move on to the next level of checks, which may involve going for site visits,” Teoh said.</p> <p>Cedar, a subsidiary of SME Bank is also a training, consultancy and research centre aimed at building the capacity of both the SMEs and the employees of development finance institutions (DFIs), which include microfinance institutions, community development financial institutions and revolving loan funds .</p> <p>Another panelist, Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Malaysia (ACCCIM) SME commitee chairman and national council member Koong Lin Loong said it is vital to bridge the gap of expectations between the entrepreneurs and the bankers.</p> <p>“Entrepreneurs expect bankers to give them bigger loans whereas bankers expect borrowers to provide more documents to justify their loan application,” Koong said.</p> <p>Elaborating further, he said bankers should understand what he called the 4Ms and how entrepreneurs function.</p> <p>“They are Money, Manpower, Marketing and Management. In the last M, the entrepreneur has to manage all the 3Ms of money, manpower and marketing,” he said.</p> <p>Koong said, as a result of the gap in expectations, surveys conducted by ACCCIM show that 80% of new entrepreneurs rely on funds from their own savings, friends or family members.</p> <p>“Some even go to Ah Longs (loan sharks). On the other hand, some also use their credit cards to draw cash advances, despite the higher interest rate and upfront fees, simply because the automated teller machine will not ask you for a business proposal or other 5C criteria,” he said.</p> <p>Teoh feels that entrepreneurs should try to address the doubts of bankers via their business plan and be clear about what their business is.</p> <p>“We have across entrepreneurs who do not know that their financial background will be checked, and some have no idea how big a loan they really need. The worst is they try to start a business just because they see a trend and try to follow,” Teoh said.</p> <p>Koong added that another document that bankers will look at is financial statements.</p> <p>“If these do not show that the business can make money, that there is no cash flow, how is the entrepreneur going to repay the bank?” he asked.</p> <p>Having said that, there are genuine entrepreneurs who needs financing and understanding the issue, the forum concluded that banks should emulate what Cedar is doing by providing training to entrepreneurs.</p> <p>Koong said banks have the resources to pool their expertise, particularly in investment banking to put up analysis on various industries that SMEs are in to help their SME lending units make better decisions. This would also include training the SMEs to better prepare themselves.</p> <p>Teoh added this is something that is similar to what Cedar is doing. The organisation currently has a team of 30 people, ranging from former entrepreneurs to professionals with knowledge in accounting, law and human resources. Teoh said they plan to increase the staff strength to 48 by end of the year.</p> <p>“It is in the bank’s interest because when we prepare entrepreneurs for loan applications, we are also helping them to refine their business proposals and mindset. In the long run, this helps reduce the bank’s number of non-performing loans,” he said.</p>\r\n",

      "<p><strong>RM50mil fund for Chinese-run SMEs from Budget 2014 to be disbursed from June 5, says Datuk Dr Wee Ka Siong. </strong></p> <p>Small companies looking for fresh funds to expand their businesses can look forward to a share of the RM50mil fund allocated to Chinese SMEs under Budget 2014, which will be disbursed as soft loans from June 5. </p> <p>Last week, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department Datuk Dr Wee Ka Siong said each SME could borrow RM50,000 to RM250,000, depending on the nature of the business. Industry observers note that the loans would certainly ease the financial burdens faced by SMEs as it widens the financing channels available to these businesses.</p> <p>Wee had said the MCA was inundated with phone calls asking about the loans.</p> <p>“Every place we visit, business people keep asking us, where can we borrow money?” he said.</p> <p>The scheme will be managed by Kojadi, MCA’s education and investment arm. The loans come with an interest rate of 4% – more competitive compared to loans provided by most other financial institutions – and would be a feasible solution for most SMEs, said Wee.</p> <p>He added that borrowers could take loans up to a maximum of five years.</p> <p>“This revolving fund will add to the large range of financial services aimed at helping SMEs,” he said, adding that SMEs would no longer have to rely on loan sharks to expand their businesses.</p> <p>The loan is open to Malaysian citizens aged 21 to 60. Applicants are required to be a member of Kojadi, with initial shares and membership entrance fees set at RM110. Applicants will also have to make a RM500 non-refundable payment of loan processing fee and administration fee, to be submitted with the application.</p> <p>Applications are expected to take seven working days upon full submission of documents.</p> <p>The loans can be used for working capital, expenditure and project financing, among other things. Businesses that have been operating for less than three years with a minimum turnover of RM200,000 a year would be considered for the loan.</p> <p>“This would indeed have a good impact on Chinese SMEs, and we are working to get the word out so that these businesses can take advantage of the loans,” said Neil Foo, CEO of Secretariat for the Advancement of Malaysian Entrepreneurs. </p> <p>“There are also other commercial banks and development financial institutions that have been set up by the government to aid SMEs. They have been around for many years. But there is an information gap whereby the businesses are not aware of these loans. So we want to get the word out,” he added.</p> <p>Repayment of the loan will be made on a monthly basis, and payment can be made directly at Kojadi’s office or to any designated Kojadi accounts with the banks.</p> <p>Application form for the loan can be downloaded from the MCA or Kojadi official website at <a href=\"http://www.mca.org.my\">www.mca.org.my</a> or http://<a href=\"http://kojadi.my\">kojadi.my</a>.</p> <p><br/> </p>\r\n",

      "<strong>Malaysian wins outstanding entrepreneur award</strong> <p>The Federation of Chinese Associations Malaysia (Huazong) deputy secretary general Datuk Dr Chin Yew Sin was recently awarded The World’s Top 10 Most Outstanding Chinese Entrepreneurs in Chongqing, China.<br/> <br/> The award was conferred by the China Economic and Trade Promotion Association together with the Federation of China’s Industrial and Commerce Associations and the the China International Economic Development Research Centre. Chin was also awarded the World’s Top 10 Outstanding Role Models of Chinese Entrepreneurs.<br/> <br/> He received the awards for his contribution in the non-govermental organisations and entrepreneurial fields category. Chin is also the secretary general of the Asean-China Economic and Trade Promotion Association Malaysia.<br/> <br/> <strong>New Islamic finance certification</strong></p> <p>SME Bank aims to produce well-trained and highly-competent personnel and executives in the Islamic finance industry with the introduction of the Chartered Islamic Development Banker (ChIDB) programme.<br/> <br/> Group managing director Datuk Mohd Radzif Mohd Yunus said the ChIDB was the banking industry’s first certification programme of its kind and would enable Malaysia to continue leading the development of Islamic finance.<br/> <br/> “The programme is jointly developed by SME Bank’s unit, Centre for Entrepreneur Development and Research Sdn Bhd (SME-CEDAR), and Islamic Banking and Finance Institute (IBFIM). It offers professional certificate programmes in Malaysia’s financial marketplace.<br/> <br/> “It will address the peculiar needs of the development financial institutions (DFIs) fraternity and offers a new pathway for the trainees in tandem with the existing chartered banker and chartered Islamic banker paths,” he said.<br/> <br/> The collaboration between SME-CEDAR and IBFIM will cover training in the area of development and delivery of Islamic banking and finance programmes for SME Bank staff and existing and potential clients.<br/> <br/> “SME Bank is ready to help produce more talents in its efforts to deliver the desired professional services in compliance with syariah law,” Radzif said.<br/> <br/> <strong>Middle East banks tighten SME credit</strong><br/> <br/> Banks in the Gulf states are tightening lending conditions for small, private companies as the region copes with declining oil prices.<br/> <br/> As it stands, lending to SMEs make up a very small amount of banks’ business. According to a World Bank study, SMEs accounted for only about 2% of GCC banks’ loans in 2010 as they typically rely more on non-bank financial companies.<br/> <br/> However, SMEs account for much of the job creation in the Gulf, reportedly employing over 40% of the workforce in Dubai, and this could affect the business community at large in the longer run.<br/> <br/> Bankers are apparently becoming more cautious about lending to SMEs because they fear low oil prices could deprive the companies of access to fresh business.<br/> <br/> Additionally, a global US regulatory crackdown on money laundering has increased the compliance costs for banks doing SME business, as banks have to spend more resources on checking their clients’ legitimacy.<br/> <br/> “We are seeing the SME sector under stress more often – sometimes a result of changes in commodity prices and sometimes liquidity-related, which may be due to some well-publicised exits from this market,” said a senior banker handling loan portfolios at a UAE bank.<br/> <br/> “Regional banks, as a result, are monitoring their exposures more intensely.”</p>\r\n",

      "<p><strong>Bank Negara’s subsidiary says SMEs need to get their papers in order while financiers ought to highlight SME schemes, reports JOY LEE.</strong></p><p>Access to finance has been a long-standing issue among small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Most small businesses complain that there is a lack of funding available to SMEs as they are, by and large, shunned by financial institutions.</p><p>However, Credit Guarantee Corp Malaysia Bhd (CGC) assistant vice president of branch performance department Hon Chee Yoong begs to differ.</p><p>“Personally, I think it is just a lack of communication between financiers and the SMEs. They don’t know what the banks’ criteria and risk appetite are. Different banks have different policies and assessments.</p><p>“SMEs should take the initiative to find out about these criteria, and financial institutions should put in more effort to educate the SMEs on the products that are available to them,” Hon points out at a recent forum entitled “SME Financial Resources”.</p><p>The forum was organised by the Secretariat for the Advancement of Malaysian Entrepreneurs (SAME) at its office last week and was moderated by chief executive officer Neil Foo. The other panellist is SAME advisor Peter Phang.</p><p>Hon explains that there are also development financial institutions, such as CGC, which enables SMEs to obtain funding.</p><p>CGC, a subsidiary of Bank Negara Malaysia, facilitates SMEs’ access to financing through direct financing schemes, as well as its guarantee schemes, particularly for those without collateral or track record.</p><p>He notes that its guarantee scheme is particularly attractive to SMEs, given that they do not require any collateral for their loans. To date, CGC has guaranteed close to RM56bil.</p><p>“Almost every bank has a CGC scheme, and SMEs have the right to ask about this scheme,” Hon says.</p><p>Businesses can also obtain loans from CGC itself. CGC has a 70% approval rate for its direct financing products. Most times, Hon says, applicants fail to secure loans due to a lack of proper documentation.</p><p>“Small businesses tend to have issues with keeping proper records, mostly because some are small enough not to qualify for auditing. But they need to do their paperwork and keep their files. It makes it easier to get their loans approved,” he says.</p><p>Phang adds that SME applicants need to ensure that they have a functional business plan and proper financial records or estimates in order to secure their loans.</p><p>“Financial institutions are particular about the company, the phase it is in, the nature of the business, its products and credibility,” he notes.</p><p>Phang admits that financing for SMEs in Malaysia is not as vibrant as that in other fully liberalised markets like Hong Kong. </p><p>Due to the competitive market in Hong Kong, Phang explains, there is a wider range of financial products available at competitive rates over there.</p><p>“It is easier to get financing in markets like Hong Kong but it is a different type of market. Here, we are doing what we can to close the gap between small businesses and financiers. There are loans available.</p><p>“The thing is, the information about these loans is not so easily available, particularly to businesses outside of the Klang Valley. The laymen don’t know that they actually have a lot of choices for financing,” says Phang, who was previously a director of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council at the Malaysia office.</p><p>Foo concludes that while SMEs may be wary about approaching financial institutions to fund their ventures, they should look into financing options offered by development financial institutions.</p>\r\n",

NAJIB BIN TUN HAJI ABDUL RAZAK</strong></p> <p><strong>PRIME MINISTER OF MALAYSIA</strong></p> <p><strong>SPECIAL ADDRESS ON CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS AND GOVERNMENT’S FINANCIAL POSITION</strong></p> <p><br/> </p> <p>Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim </p> <p>Assalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh dan Salam 1 Malaysia</p> <p>YAB Tan Sri Muhyidin Yassin</p> <p>Timbalan Perdana Menteri</p> <p>YB Dato’ Seri Ahmad Husni Hanadzlah</p> <p>Menteri Kewangan Kedua</p> <p>YBhg. Tan Sri Dr. Ali Hamsa</p> <p>Ketua Setiausaha Negara 4</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>1. First and foremost, let us express our infinite gratitude towards Allah SWT for with His blessings, we are able to gather this morning. We also pray for the great prophet Muhammad SAW.</p> <p>2. We are here this morning with leaders and administrators, civil servants, industry players and corporate members, representatives of embassies, NGOs and volunteer groups, as well as the rakyat in this hall, and those watching TV or listening to the speech.</p> <p>3. I would like to address some concerns on the current economic developments and the Government’s financial position. Lately, there have been reports, concerns and queries on issues, such as crude oil prices and performance of the ringgit.</p> <p>4. The Government has been vigilantly monitoring the situation. In this regard, I will announce several proactive measures to realign our policies in line with the changing global economic scenario, which is beyond our control. We are undertaking this to ensure that we continue to achieve creditable growth.</p> <p>5. In other words, I am here today to announce specific and proactive measures to align ourselves with the recent global economic developments.</p> <p>6. We are not in crisis. Indeed, we are taking preemptive measures following the changes in the external global economic landscape which is beyond our control.</p> <p>7. This is to ensure that our economy continues to attain a respectable and reasonable growth. And at the same time, we want to ensure development for the nation and rakyat continues.</p> <p>8. Indeed, 2014 was a year of trials and tribulations for us due to several tragedies.</p> <p>9. At the end of last year, Malaysia was hit by unprecedented floods, affecting several states including Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, Kedah and Perak.</p> <p>10. Although the floods were not so severe in Johor, Sabah and Sarawak, local communities in some areas were affected.</p> <p>11. Thus, it is said that while man plans, Allah SWT plans too. And Allah SWT is the best of the planners.</p> <p>12. The Government has always done its best to plan, formulate and implement policies and measures for the betterment of the rakyat.</p> <p>13. It has been three months since the 2015 Budget was tabled. The Budget was formulated based on; First, price of Dated Brent was forecast at USD100 per barrel.</p> <p>14. Second, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth estimated between 5% and 6%. Third, a stable exchange rate of RM3.20 against the US dollar; and</p> <p>15. Fourth, 2015 world economic growth was projected at 3.4% and 3.9% by the World Bank and IMF respectively. Since then, the World Bank and the IMF have revised global growth to 3% and 3.8% respectively.</p> <p>16. It should be noted that Budget 2015 was formulated based on strong economic fundamentals in 2014. Therefore, the fiscal deficit was forecast from 3.5% in 2014 to 3% of GDP in 2015.</p> <p>17. However, the external situation has changed lately and we are impacted directly as Malaysia is among the largest trading nations in the world.</p> <p>18. Compared to the situation a few months ago, the global economic landscape has since changed significantly. This necessitates us to review and clarify some of our earlier macro and fiscal assumptions.</p> <p>19. Among the issues raised is the Government’s ability to achieve its fiscal targets for 2015. Given the current situation, the question is whether the economy and Government’s financial position will be affected.</p> <p>20. In this special address, I will explain to the rakyat and announce several measures to mitigate the current economic situation.</p> <p>21. As a responsible Government, we will continue to ensure economic development and safeguard the well-being of the rakyat.</p> <p><strong>Declining Crude Oil Prices</strong></p> <p>22. We are aware of the concerns among the rakyat, business community and analysts over the impact of the sharp fall in crude oil prices on the domestic economy.</p> <p>23. Over the last six months, global crude oil prices have plunged more than 50%, among others, due to oversupply amid weak demand.</p> <p>24. Leveraging advances in technology, shale oil and gas output has risen significantly in the US.</p> <p>25. The situation is exacerbated by higher output from non-OPEC (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries). OPEC is also not willing to undertake production cuts in order to maintain its market share.</p> <p>26. The Government has consistently reiterated that crude oil prices are beyond its control.</p> <p>27. The benchmark Dated Brent crude oil price has dropped to around USD48 per barrel on 19 January 2015. And analysts expect oil prices to take quite a while to stabilise.</p> <p><strong>Benefits of Declining Crude Oil Prices</strong></p> <p>28. Lower crude oil prices benefit net oil importing countries like Malaysia.</p> <p>29. For instance, the recent reduction in pump prices of petrol and diesel by 35 sen and 30 sen per litre, respectively will increase the overall disposable income of consumers by RM7.5 billion. Assuming that consumers spend 40% of this amount, it will boost private consumption by RM3 billion.</p> <p>30. The World Bank estimates that lower crude oil prices will have a positive impact on world GDP. In fact, a 30% decline in oil prices could boost global GDP of up to 0.5%.</p> <p>31. This bodes well for Malaysia’s manufactured products. Further, with the US economy strengthening, there will be sustained demand for our exports, in particular electrical and electronics (E&amp;E) products.</p> <p><strong>Falling Crude Oil Prices will Reduce Federal Government Revenue</strong></p> <p>32. In contrast, falling crude oil prices will reduce Government revenue. The revenue is used for development purposes such as building of schools, roads and houses of worship. It is also used for other expenditures such as salaries of civil servants, cost of medicine in Government hospitals, agriculture subsidies and expenditure for security including armed forces, police and RELA.</p> <p>33. In 2014, Dated Brent reached its highest level at USD115 per barrel on 19 June. Global crude oil prices have since plummeted by more than 50%.</p> <p>34. Consensus among economists is that the forecast price of USD100 per barrel used in the 2015 Budget is no longer realistic. They now estimate the average oil price in 2015 to range from USD40 to USD70 per barrel.</p> <p>35. The Government has therefore revised downwards its forecast for the average baseline oil price to USD55 per barrel for 2015.</p> <p>36. Based on the crude oil price of USD100 per barrel, coupled with savings following the implementation of the managed float pricing mechanism for retail fuel prices effective from December 2014, the Government is expected to get an additional operating surplus of RM3.7 billion.</p> <p>37. If crude oil price remains at USD100 per barrel, the Government will be able to accommodate all the measures announced in Budget 2015 with the fiscal deficit target not exceeding 3% of GDP.</p> <p>38. However, at the forecast price of USD55 per barrel, there will be a revenue shortfall of RM13.8 billion.</p> <p>39. If we compare the revised figures with Budget 2015 tabled in October last year, despite the savings of RM10.7 billion from the implementation of the managed float mechanism for retail fuel prices, the Government still faces a revenue shortfall of RM8.3 billion to accommodate the 2015 Budget measures.</p> <p>40. Without any fiscal measures, the deficit will increase to 3.9% of GDP against the target of 3% for 2015.</p> <p>41. This requires the Government to take measures to reduce the deficit, in line with the Government’s commitment towards fiscal consolidation.</p> <p>42. Therefore, taking into account the revised estimates, we are revising the fiscal deficit target to 3.2% of GDP in 2015.</p> <p>43. This is still lower than the fiscal deficit of 3.5% of GDP in 2014. In view of the external factors, we have to acknowledge that we may not be able to achieve the earlier fiscal target of 3% of GDP as announced. Of importance, is our commitment to continue reducing the fiscal deficit from 3.5% of GDP.</p> <p>44. More importantly, we will not compromise on national development planning as it will enhance productive capacity of the economy. We will not neglect the rakyat’s welfare, particularly the bottom 40% of households.</p> <p><strong>Volatile Capital Flows and Ringgit</strong></p> <p>45. The fluctuations in the ringgit are influenced by developments in the global economy. Hence, the ringgit is not the only currency to have weakened against the US dollar. In fact, almost all currencies in the region have softened against the US dollar since September 2014.</p> <p>46. The recent volatile capital flows and significant depreciation of the ringgit were also due to concerns over the impact of the sharp fall in oil prices on the Malaysian economy.</p> <p>47. In relation to this, we must closely monitor the following:</p> <p>First, the current account in the balance of payments must remain in surplus.</p> <p>Second, continue with fiscal reforms and consolidation and</p> <p>Third, economic activity must be further diversified to enable us to cope with falling crude oil and commodity prices.</p> <p>48. The Government is confident that the exchange rate will over time adjust to reflect the strong economic fundamentals. Of importance, our financial system continues to function in an orderly manner.</p> <p>49. Most importantly, there has been no disruption to financial intermediation, with lending activities continuing smoothly. Businesses continue to have access to financing from banking institutions and the capital market.</p> <p>50. In essence, greater policy flexibility, adequate international reserves, deeper and more diversified financial markets, sound banking system and strong domestic institutional investors such as the Employees Provident Fund will increase resilience to volatile capital flows.</p> <p><strong>Current Account Balance</strong></p> <p>51. The current account balance is directly related to the import and export of goods and services.</p> <p>52. We are a crude oil exporter. Thus, when oil prices plummeted recently, there was a perception that export receipts will also decline drastically and result in a current account deficit.</p> <p>53. Indeed, this perception is not correct. As a net crude oil exporter, we had a surplus of RM7.7bil from January to November 2014.</p> <p>54. However, we are an importer of petroleum products with a net import bill of RM8.9bil during the same period.</p> <p>55. If we include both crude oil and petroleum products, we are actually a net importer with a deficit of RM1.2bil.</p> <p>56. Therefore, the perception that Malaysia is a large oil producer is also not true.</p> <p>57. However, if we factor in exports and imports of crude oil, and nett out petroleum products, then Malaysia is a net importer of petroleum. This does not include LNG, for which Malaysia is a net exporter.</p> <p>58. Furthermore, we are still resilient as our diversified economy is able to weather the decline in oil prices.</p> <p>59. With a better outlook for the global economy in 2015, the shortfall in commodity receipts is expected to be cushioned by increased demand for manufactured goods, such as electrical and electronic products, wood-based products, textile products and others, which account for 76% of total exports. Meanwhile, crude oil exports account for only 4.5% of total exports.</p> <p>60. Therefore, the Government is confident that the current account will remain in surplus this year, although smaller in the range of 2% to 3% of Gross National Income or GNI. In 2014, the current account balance is estimated to record a surplus at 5.1% of GNI.</p> <p><strong>Strategies to Strengthen Economic Resilience</strong></p> <p>61. As I have explained earlier, there are several issues which will impact the domestic economy significantly. In the light of this, the Government will take measures to ensure economic growth remains on a strong trajectory. We are confident of achieving GDP growth in the range of 4.5% - 5.5% this year with the implementation of the following strategies:</p> <p>- First: Ensure balanced, inclusive and sustainable economic growth;</p> <p>- Second: Continue fiscal reforms and consolidation; and</p> <p>- Third: Provide assistance to the rakyat and business community to rebuild infrastructure damaged by floods.</p> <p>62. First Strategy: Ensuring Balanced, Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Growth To boost exports of goods and services, the following measures will be taken:</p> <p>First, actively promote import-substitution services such as shipping, port, education and professional services. This will reduce dependence on foreign sources for procurement of goods and services;</p> <p>Second, accelerate implementation of recommendations of National Export Council:</p> <p>- Enable exporters, especially SMEs, to be connected to new clients in new markets under an international linkage programme using market linkers and industry specialists;</p> <p>- Intensify export promotion programmes in 46 countries covering Asia, Europe, the Middle East and the US;</p> <p>- SME Bank will introduce SME-Go, an export programme for SMEs; and</p> <p>- Leverage the Services Export Fund (SEF) and promotional programmes for SMEs to enhance sustainability of projects abroad.</p> <p>Third, frontload implementation of Logistics &amp; Trade Facilitation:</p> <p>- Improve last-mile connectivity to Port Klang including access road, railway network and traffic management system;</p> <p>- Upgrade Padang Besar railway terminal;</p> <p>- Improve operational efficiency of import and export processes; and</p> <p>- Establish a hub and spoke system for air transport.</p> <p>Fourth, intensify tourism industry;</p> <p>Fifth, review levy on foreign workers; and</p> <p>Sixth, waiver of visa fee for tourists from, among others, China.</p> <p>To enhance private consumption, the Government will implement the following initiatives:</p> <p>First, give priority to local class G1 (class F), G2 (class E) and G3 (class D) contractors registered with CIDB to undertake reconstruction works in their respective flood affected areas;</p> <p>Second, intensify promotion of “Buy Malaysia” products;</p> <p>Third, increase frequency and extend shopping hours of nationwide mega sales;</p> <p>Fourth, accelerate promotion of domestic tourism through competitive domestic air fares; and</p> <p>Fifth, encourage the private sector to leverage benefits from the establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community.</p> <p>In efforts to accelerate private investment, the Government will:</p> <p>First, set up a Services Sector Guarantee Scheme amounting to RM5 billion for SMEs in the services sector, with maximum financing of RM5 million and 70% Government guarantee;</p> <p>Second, encourage GLCs and GLICs to invest domestically;</p> <p>Third, reduce cost of doing business:</p> <p>- Postpone the scheduled electricity tariff hike in 2015; and</p> <p>- Postpone the scheduled gas price hike for the industrial sector in 2015.</p> <p>Fourth, allocate 30% of the annual procurement budget of Government agencies and GLCs for goods and services to local SME producers; and</p> <p>Fifth, increase local goods and services in Government procurement.</p> <p>63. Second Strategy: Continuing Fiscal Reforms and Consolidation Among the revenue enhancement measures include:</p> <p>First, broaden the tax base by encouraging companies to register with the Royal Malaysian Customs to enable them to charge and collect GST. This is expected to contribute an additional RM1 billion in GST collection. As at mid-January 2015, more than 304,000 companies have registered; and</p> <p>Second, realise additional dividends from GLCs and GLICs as well as other Government entities amounting to RM400mil.</p> <p>The Government will undertake the following expenditure rationalisation measures:</p> <p>First, optimise outlays on supplies and services, especially overseas travel, events and functions and use of professional services. This will result in savings of RM1.6bil;</p> <p>Second, defer the 2015 Program Latihan Khidmat Negara to enable the programme to be reviewed and enhanced, with savings expected at RM400 million;</p> <p>Third, review transfers and grants to statutory bodies, GLCs and Government Trust Funds, particularly those with a steady revenue stream and high reserves. This measure will result in savings of RM3.2 billion; and</p> <p>Fourth, reschedule the purchase of non-critical assets, especially office equipment, software and vehicles, with an expected savings of RM300 million.</p> <p>64. Third Strategy: Assisting the Rakyat and Business Community as well as Rebuilding Infrastructure Damaged by the Floods</p> <p>The recent floods affected around 400,000 people nationwide. The latest estimate of damage to infrastructure is about RM2.9bil.</p> <p>Among the measures that have been taken and will be implemented to assist flood victims include:</p> <p>The Government has provided an initial allocation of RM500 million for rehabilitation works and welfare programmes for flood victims.</p> <p>This is in addition to the existing allocation to the National Security Council, bringing the total to RM787mil.</p> <p>Provide an initial allocation of RM800mil for repair and reconstruction of basic infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, roads and bridges;</p> <p>Provide RM893 million under the 2015 Budget for flood mitigation projects;</p> <p>Build 8-ft stilt houses for those who have land and whose homes were damaged by the floods; Hand over 1,000 units of completed low-cost houses in Gua Musang; Provide RM500 per flood affected household; and Provide RM5,000 for the next-of-kin who have lost family members.</p> <p>65. For businesses affected by floods:</p> <p>- Provide an additional RM100 million to TEKUN and RM100 million to AIM to provide soft loans to support SMEs and microenterprises.</p> <p>66. BSN, Agrobank, SME Bank, TEKUN and AIM to defer existing loan repayments of up to six months.</p> <p>67. Bank Negara Malaysia will establish a RM500 million Special Relief Facility for SME loan financing at a concessionary rate of 2.25% with a grace period of up to six months through banking and development financial institutions;</p> <p>68. Bank Rakyat will offer a personal loan scheme of up to RM50,000 at a financing rate as low as 3.9%, while loan repayments will start after six months from loan disbursement;</p> <p>69. A sum of RM500 million will be provided by financial institutions with a 70% guarantee under a Flood Relief Loan Guarantee Scheme (Skim Jaminan Pinjaman Bantuan Banjir) (SJPBB). The Scheme will be administered by Prokhas; and</p> <p>70. Exempt levy payment to the Human Resources Development Fund (HRDF) for a period of six months for SMEs in the flood affected areas with effect from 1 February 2015.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p><strong>To sum up, I would like to highlight 6 key take-aways:</strong></p> <p>First, we are neither in a recession nor a crisis as experienced in 1997/1998, and 2009 which warranted stimulus packages;</p> <p>Second, the strategies announced by the Government are proactive initiatives to make the necessary adjustments following the challenging external developments which are beyond our control. This is a reality check following, among others, declining global crude oil prices;</p> <p>Third, the current account balance is expected to remain in surplus;</p> <p>Fourth, the financial markets remain orderly and resilient. Although the ringgit has depreciated, it is expected to stabilise over time to reflect the strong economic fundamentals;</p> <p>Fifth, Development Expenditure of RM48.5 billion for 2015 will be maintained and spent.</p> <p>This includes projects for the people economy such as public housing, flood mitigation, water supply, electricity and public transport infrastructure such as Pan-Borneo Highway.</p> <p>In addition, projects such as the MRT Line 2, LRT 3, High-Speed Rail Kuala Lumpur-Singapore will be continued.</p> <p>In May, I will table the Eleventh Malaysia Plan (11MP) to outline the development expenditure until 2020.</p> <p>Sixth, Operating Expenditure is expected to be reduced by RM5.5 billion through reprioritising expenditure.</p> <p>71. In concluding, let us pray and hope that Allah SWT will always assist us in our efforts to find solutions.</p> <p>72. In all of human nature, to Allah SWT we submit and surrender to His will. Of importance, we stand together in solidarity to face challenges.</p> <p>73. Surely, with every difficulty there is relief.</p> <p>74. Hopefully God Almighty will continue to protect our beloved country from harm and danger.</p> <p> </p> <p>Thank you.</p> <p><br/> </p> <p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px; border: none; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #444444; font-size: 15.555556297302246px; line-height: 22.986112594604492px; background-color: #ffffff;\"><strong style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none;\">Related stories:</strong></p> <p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px; border: none; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #444444; font-size: 15.555556297302246px; line-height: 22.986112594604492px; background-color: #ffffff;\"><a href=\"http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2015/01/20/Budget-Revision-Waiver-of-visa-fee-for-tourists\" style=\"font-size: 15.555556297302246px; line-height: 22.986112594604492px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none; text-decoration: none; cursor: pointer;\">Budget Revision: Visa fee waiver for tourists</a></p> <p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px; border: none; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #444444; font-size: 15.555556297302246px; line-height: 22.986112594604492px; background-color: #ffffff;\"><a href=\"http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2015/01/20/Budget-Revision-National-Service\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none; text-decoration: none; color: #107fc9; cursor: pointer;\">Budget Revision: National Service 2015 suspended</a></p> <p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px; border: none; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #444444; font-size: 15.555556297302246px; line-height: 22.986112594604492px; background-color: #ffffff;\"><a href=\"http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2015/01/20/Budget-Revision-Najib\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none; text-decoration: none; color: #107fc9; cursor: pointer;\">Budget Revision: Highlights</a></p> <p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px; border: none; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #444444; font-size: 15.555556297302246px; line-height: 22.986112594604492px; background-color: #ffffff;\"><a href=\"http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2015/01/20/Budget-Revision-Made-in-Malaysia-goods\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none; text-decoration: none; color: #107fc9; cursor: pointer;\">Budget Revision: Focus on Malaysian-manufactured goods</a></p> <p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px; border: none; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #444444; font-size: 15.555556297302246px; line-height: 22.986112594604492px; background-color: #ffffff;\"><a href=\"http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2015/01/20/Budget-Revision-flood-recovery\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none; text-decoration: none; color: #107fc9; cursor: pointer;\">Budget Revision: RM8.9bil for flood recovery efforts</a></p> <p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px; border: none; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #444444; font-size: 15.555556297302246px; line-height: 22.986112594604492px; background-color: #ffffff;\"><a href=\"http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2015/01/20/Budget-Revision-electric-tariff/\">Budget Revision: Government postpones electricity tariff hike</a><br/> <br/> </p> <p><br/> </p> <p> </p>\r\n",

During the same period, loan disbursements grew 13% to RM601.2bil. Meanwhile, loan applications and loan approvals declined 1.9% and 2.4% respectively. </p><p> The manufacturing sector continued to account for most of the loans disbursed at 20.6%, followed by the wholesale and retail trade, restaurants and hotels sectors at 20.4%. </p><p> As at end July 2014, loans outstanding to the business sector increased 6.8% to RM467.6bil. </p><p> Financing for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) also moderated with applications and approvals declining 5.3% and 12.6% to RM105.2bil and RM37bil respectively. </p><p> Most of the loans were to the finance, insurance and business activities sectors as well as the wholesale and retail trade, restaurants and hotels sectors. </p><p> In addition to that, five revolving funds administered by Bank Negara also provided financing to SMEs. From January to July 2014, loans were approved to 1,859 SMEs amounting to RM724.4mil and since the establishment of these funds, 60,648 SMEs have benefited from RM25bil of total financing approved with an average utilisation rate of 68.8%. </p>\r\n",

These include launching a crowd-funding platform and developing operating rules for a National Bill Payment Scheme, according to the newly-released Economic Transformation Programme annual report for 2013. </p><p> The launch of a crowd-funding platform by the Securities Commission follows the introduction of a conceptual framework for Malaysia’s first online platform for unlisted securities and alternative investment products, or MyULM, last year.  </p><p> This is to provide a platform to match investors with small and medium enterprises seeking financing to expand their business.</p><p> The report said NKEA also aimed to establish a framework for the provision of basic life insurance and family takaful products through direct channels this year; and organise investor education and awareness programmes to promote the Private Retirement Scheme. </p><p> The NKEA also expects to finalise the Asean Banking Integration Framework for endorsement at the Asean finance ministers’ meeting this year.</p><p> As Bursa Malaysia looks to grow retail participation and build a trading and investing mindset amongst Malaysians, especially the younger generation, the exchange is focusing on technology and innovative channels such as the digital platform to expand its reach. Bursa Malaysia is hopeful that the launch of the new eCommunity platform in the first half of 2014 will enable the exchange to reach a wider span of retail investors, in a quicker and more efficient manner. </p><p> The report said the exchange would continue to leverage on Asean growth to attract more investors to the Malaysian market, as part of its efforts to become Asean’s leading marketplace. </p><p> Second Finance Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Husni Hanadzlah said it was essential for Malaysia to develop its financial sector carefully and assiduously, as the industry played a significant role in ensuring stability and facilitating the development of the country’s economy.</p><p> In the face of potential sources of systemic risk, Ahmad Husni said it was imperative that efforts were put in place to ensure the resilience of the country’s financial system.</p><p> The financial services NKEA successfully met almost all of its key performance indicators last year. These included the issuance of a sustainable social lending framework for development financial institutions, devising the framework on a trading venue for unlisted firms, and surpassing the target value of new listings (including GLC listings).</p><p> The report said NKEA was focused on developing Malaysia’s financial industry in tandem with the needs of a high-income nation. The 10 entry point projects have been put in place to strengthen the industry’s core; serve the needs of a high-income population; develop new growth sectors; and aggressively target new markets and enhance the industry’s niche in Islamic finance. </p><p> The initiatives target to grow the industry’s gross national income contribution to RM180.2bil and create 275,400 new jobs by 2020.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>PETALING JAYA: The current level of household debt, which stands at about 83% to gross domestic product (GDP), will not impact Malaysian banks’ creditworthiness as the existing and new measures are sufficient to prevent it from becoming a bubble, according to analysts. </p> <p> A banking analyst with a bank-backed brokerage told <em>StarBiz </em>that the research house was comfortable with the current level of household debt.</p> <p> “In view of the ongoing and upcoming measures to rein in rising household debt, we believe that the risk of household debt becoming a bubble is well contained,” he added.</p> <p> Analysts at Standard &amp; Poor’s said in a recent report that Asia’s increasing household leverage, mainly from rising mortgages, could be risky for Asian banks’ creditworthiness.</p> <p> They noted that Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and South Korea had the highest household debt in Asia and that banks in Malaysia and Thailand were the most vulnerable to a deterioration in the household segment.</p> <p> They said the rapid increase in household leverage had outpaced income growth and undermined household resilience.</p> <p> Besides the measures to curb speculation in housing announced in the Budget 2014, the banking analyst does not foresee Bank Negara introducing new measures other than potentially raising the overnight policy rate by 25 to 50 basis points next year to further contain the high household debt. </p> <p> RAM Ratings co-head of financial institution ratings Wong Yin Ching said despite the current level of household debt, the credit quality of the banking system’s household sector was robust, with the gross impaired-loan ratio declining to a low 1.3% as at end-September. </p> <p> “The underwriting standards of banks have been sound, reinforced by the central bank’s series of prudential measures on residential property financing since end-2010. </p> <p> “Together with the recent budget measures on higher real property gains tax and prohibition of developer interest bearing scheme for new property purchases, housing loan growth is expected to moderate, going forward,” she said. </p> <p> However, fundamental demand from genuine buyers was still expected to remain healthy, supported by the nation’s young demographics, rural-urban migration and low unemployment rate, she added.</p> <p> The household debt-to-GDP ratio has been rising from 69% as at end-2006 to over 80% currently, Wong said, adding that the banking system’s household loans made up the bulk of the household debt, with the remainder coming from non-bank and development financial institutions, treasury’s housing-loan schemes and insurance companies. </p> <p> The main drivers of the rising household debt had been housing loans (45% of household debt) and, to a lesser extent, personal financing (17%), she added.</p> <p> OCBC Bank (M) Bhd country chief risk officer Choo Yee Kwan said the personal financing segment would be the most likely to be affected by changes in the economy should there be any upward interest rate adjustments or an increase in the cost of living.</p> <p> “While the increase in asset prices in Malaysia (on a national average basis) has not reached levels which can cause alarm, there is the concern that asset bubbles could start to form in certain localities or sub-regions within Malaysia. </p> <p> “Already, it is clear that the primary market in Malaysia is more robust than the secondary market – this is a sign that the underlying strength in this sector is losing some momentum,” he said. </p> <p> Hence, pre-emptive measures taken would be helpful to preserve the stability and prospects for this important sector of the Malaysian economy for the longer term, he added.</p> <p> </p>\r\n",

      "<div><br/> </div> <p>PETALING JAYA: A move to restructure the Government’s housing loan division will shave the fiscal debt and possibly raise housing loan growth by commercial banks.</p> <p>Analysts are expecting the Government to transfer RM42bil's worth of civil servant housing loans into the banking system, whereby staff will pay the normal 4% per annum and the Government will subsidise any interest above that threshold.</p> <p>All commercial banks are also expected to be eligible to participate in providing housing loans for government servants, and analysts expect the transfer of loans to commercial banks and development financial institutions will lower total federal government debt by around 4% to 4.5% from 51.8% of GDP as of June 30, 2013. </p> <p>The idea to restructure the Government’s housing loan division was first mentioned in last year’s Budget as part of efforts to consolidate the fiscal deficit and to ease the Government’s financial burden. During the budget speech it was mentioned that the Government would appoint panels from commercial banks to manage new housing loans effective January 2013. </p> <p>But this had yet to implemented, said a local research house. </p> <p>The research house reckoned the staff housing loans would be transferred to government-owned development financial institutions such as Bank Rakyat, Bank Simpanan Nasional, Agro Bank and Bank Pembangunan, which will manage and administer the existing stock and future stream of civil service home loans. </p> <p>Another a local bank-backed brokerage analyst said whether it made sense or not for banks to be allowed to handle government staff housing loans would much depend on the profitability of such loans.</p> <p>“Banks should take into account whether in the long term it is profitable to do so after weighing in various factors such as its capital consideration and interest rate environment, among others,’’ he told StarBiz.</p> <p>He said the treasury housing loans charged a flat rate of 4% (compared with between 4.2% and 4.3% for new home loans by commercial banks), and it would all depend on whether banks make a profit after taking into consideration the above factors over the long term.</p> <p>An industry observer said the move could uplift loan growth in the banking system, coupled with other positive factors, if some of the RM42bil were to be transferred to commercial banks. </p> <p>Another bank-backed analyst said the transfer could be positive for the banking system as the recent measures to shorten the tenure for mortgage and personal loans, as well as the potential fiscal tightening by the Federal Government via subsidy rationalisation programme in the later part of the year, could dampen loan growth momentum in the retail segments.</p> <p>This move to transfer could to an extent boost loan growth in the banking system moving forward. Total banking system loan growth to date stands at RM1.17tril. Some analysts are, however, maintaining their loan growth projections this year. </p> <p>On a year-to-date annualised basis, the banking system’s outstanding loans growth was relatively flattish at 9.8% in August. Property loans remained the key driver, where loans for the purchase of residential and non-residential properties accounted for 56% of credit growth. </p> <p>This is followed by working capital and hire purchase loans, contributing 15.2% and 11% of credit growth, respectively.</p> <p>Lending indicators for August gained momentum year-on-year, but fell on a month-on-month basis. </p> <p> Loan applications, approvals and disbursements dropped by 9.9%, 8.1% and 2.4% month-on-month to RM67.5bil (July 2013: RM75bil), RM33.5bil (July 2013: RM36.5bil) and RM80.1bil (July 2013: RM82.1bil), respectively.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>PETALING JAYA: Although the latest measures introduced by Bank Negara to rein in household debt would ensure a sound and sustainable household sector, more is needed to prevent debt from reaching alarming levels, said economists.</p><p> The household debt in Malaysia, which stands at about 83% of gross domestic product (GDP), is higher than many other countries in the region like the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan. If not prevented, it could put a damper on the country’s 5%-6% projected GDP growth this year.</p><p> RAM Holdings Bhd group chief economist Dr Yeah Kim Leng said he believes the latest measures, in combination with the earlier ones, would have the cumulative, albeit modest and gradual, effect of crimping household debt. </p><p> The latest measures would help to moderate the increase in total household debt, as the earlier responsible lending guidelines introduced last year have only had a marginal impact on slowing down the rise in total household debt to 13.0% in 2012 from 13.4% in 2011. </p><p> Certain measures, therefore, have to be in place in combination with the existing ones to ensure the soundness and sustainability of the household sector. “The loan-to-value (LTV), currently at 70% for the third housing loan, and debt-to-income net of all other borrowing measures, could be further tightened. For instance, the 70% LTV could be lowered or applied to the second or first loan, while the debt-to-income could be lowered to 30% instead of 50% of monthly net income,’’ he told <i>StarBiz</i>. </p><p> In addition, he said the net income could be defined more stringently to include other obligations of the borrower. To rein in excessive property price increases that have contributed to rising property loan demand, the real property gains tax (RPGT) could be further raised to curb speculative activities, he added. </p><p> Other complementary measures needed include efforts to boost housing supply and containing construction cost increases, he said, adding that more blunt monetary measures such as raising the overnight policy rate or banks’ reserve requirements could be applied if the macro-prudential measures applied thus far prove inadequate to contain household debt build-up.</p><p> The latest measures by the central bank to curb household debt include imposing a maximum tenure of 10 years for the repayment of personal loans and a maximum of 35 years for property loans, and prohibiting the offering of pre-approved personal financing products.</p><p> Apart from this, key credit providers are required to observe prudent debt service ratios in their credit assessment to ensure households have sufficient buffers to protect them against rising costs and unexpected adverse events. The bank’s new measures also bring some of the lending practices at development financial institutions and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) in line with those of conventional banks.</p><p> Malaysian Rating Corporation Bhd chief economist Nor Zahidi Alias said more measures were needed to curb speculative activities. “Implementing more measures to curb speculative activities in the property market can be positive. This may include a lower LTV ratio for third property purchases, higher stamp duty for property transactions and higher RPGT. All these would help curb speculative activities,’’ he noted.</p><p> He said the latest measures by the central bank were positive in view of the serious level of household debt in the country. The growth in personal financing has been robust in the past several years, especially among NBFIs, he said, adding that NBFIs had collectively extended 57% of personal financing credit to households in 2012. </p><p> Zahidi said no doubt they are secured by automatic salary deductions (for civil servants), but the rapid surge in the amount of personal financing extended to households would pose some sort of risk to the economy through a possible decline in private consumption in the event of a serious downturn.</p><p> He foresees the household debt level beginning to stabilise next year should the new measures begin to take effect in controlling the growth in personal financing. He said no doubt there was still a sizeable amount of loans related to mortgages, but at least, they were backed by underlying assets.</p><p> In a recent report, Bank Negara governor Tan Sri Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz noted that housing loans formed the bulk of Malaysia’s household debt at 44.5%, while 16.8% were personal loans.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>THIS is turning out to be generally an interesting time for <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=MBSB\" target=\"_blank\">Malaysia Building Society Bhd</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=MBSB\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a> (MBSB) following the enforcement of Financial Services Act 2013 (FSA). The non-bank financial provider next course of action will be closely-watched by investors and the industry. </p> <p> Under the previous Banking and Financial Institution Act 1989 (Bafia), MBSB is defined as a scheduled institution. The status of an exempt finance company was granted to MBSB on March 1, 1972 by the Finance Ministry and the status has remained since and is thus not bounded by any financial regulators in Malaysia. The status allows MBSB to undertake a financing business in the absence of a banking license. </p> <p> Analysts say under the new legislation, the Finance Ministry could designate financial intermediaries not under the supervision of central bank as a prescribed financial institution, if such intermediaries are deemed to pose a risk to financial stability, thus it will be interesting to see what will this mean for MBSB. </p> <p> Alliance Research analyst Cheah King Yoong says under Section 212 of the FSA, Bank Negara is authorised to supervise entities previously not under its charge. </p> <p> “Bank Negara is authorised to supervise financial entities previously not under the supervision of the central bank but are now deemed to pose a systemic risk to the overall financial stability by the Finance Ministry. This could impact the relatively large non-banking entities currently not under supervision of Bank Negara such as MBSB,” he says. </p> <p> In addition, Maybank Investment Bank Research analyst Desmond Ch’ng says technically, this could bring MBSB and the development financial institutions (DFIs) under BNM’s purview, but only if they pose a risk to financial stability.</p> <p> “Assuming MBSB is designated as a prescribed financial institution, the near-term impact could be negative from a reclassification of its non-performing loan (NPL) on a 3-month rather than 6-month basis which could raise NPL levels and the need to shore up capital,</p> <p> “Secondly, MBSB would likely have to raise equity capital much sooner than expected to bolster its capital base (its Tier 1 capital ratio was 6.6% end-Sep 2012),” Ch’ng says. </p> <p> </p> <div class=\"embeded-image inline-image-left\"> <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com.my/~/media/BAA1B00509E846638371D123BB7A8CC9.ashx\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"128\" src=\"https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/8A398CE8-EF3C-4BBF-BD04-BD5E42F0DDBA\" width=\"200\"/></a> <div class=\"inline-caption\">Click on image for larger view</div> </div> <p> Reclassifying MBSB’s NPLs from six months to a three-month basis is necessary to enable MBSB to evaluate the progress of its transformation vis-à-vis the commercial banks under Bank Negara’s purview.</p> <p> A local bank-backed analyst says that presently, it remains “status quo” for MBSB unless it is deemed as posing a systemic risk to the financial stability. “MBSB is not governed under the now repealed BAFIA and its books are not audited. The caveat for MBSB to come under the central bank’s charge is if it is deemed risky.”</p> <p> He adds that the FSA opens up an opportunity for Bank Negara to look at its books as they don’t have any restriction from doing that for now. </p> <p> Analysts say the concern on MBSB is its burgeoning portfolio of personal loans to civil servants. </p> <p> Started in 1950 as the Federal and Colonial Building Society Ltd, the loan portfolio for MBSB has grown significantly from just providing mortgages. Its biggest earnings contributor now is made up of personal loans to civil servants and it has since expanded into financing retail businesses, corporate outfits, wholesale banking and treasury products.</p> <p> As at Dec 31, 2012 (FY12), MBSB’s total loans rose to RM24.3bil with the bulk of it coming from personal loans. </p> <p> MBSB’s Personal Financing-i (PF-i) has grown tremendously in the past five years. In 2009, its PF-i accounted for just about 11.6% of its gross loans and this has swelled to 66.3% in 2012. Concurrently, its mortgage which formed the bulk of its gross loans in 2009 accounting for 47.9% has reduced to 18.5% in the first quarter. Its auto loans are gaining traction, especially since the company tied up with the Naza Group.</p> <p> In addition, MBSB has also been reducing its total net NPL ratios over the years to 4.5% in FY12 from a high of 19.54% in 2009. MBSB’s deposit growth has also registered a significant growth in FY12. Its deposit rose to RM21.5bil in FY12 from RM7.6bil in FY09. </p> <p> In the first quarter ended March 31, 2013, MBSB saw its net loans and financing grew more than 50% to RM26.6bil from RM17.6bil in the first quarter in 2012. It reported a net profit of RM166.14mil or 13.08 sen per share in the first quarter ended March 31 compared with RM79.41mil or 6.53 sen per share a year ago, underpinned by its Islamic banking operations and lower impairment losses.</p> <p> MBSB’s pre-tax profit surged 114.6% to RM237.11mil from RM110.47mil while revenue rose 48.4% to RM562.47mil from RM378.88mil.</p> <p> For 2013, MBSB aims to bring its loan-to-deposit ratio down to 95%, while a 20% target has been set for loan and deposit growth.</p> <p> Nevertheless, MBSB is already working towards complying with Bank Negara guidelines but is not in a hurry to get a banking licence from Bank Negara. In March, MBSB chief operating officer Clifford Anthony Clement reportedly said MBSB is already revamping its internal structure to prepare to comply with the FSA. </p> <p> President and chief executive officer Datuk Ahmad Zaini Othman says MBSB must first practise and perform like a bank before its application can be approved by the central bank. “Licence is something that can come later but we must get ready to operate and move into the banking environment first to train ourselves to be ready.”</p> <p><br/> </p> <strong>Related stories:</strong> <br/> <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=F5EF6A99E30D426AA11855851EA1BFF9&amp;_z=z\">Shadow banking crisis</a> <br/> <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=2E7DA1F01D7C44E394F93026AE02D7A0&amp;_z=z\">Angkasa in the news for overlending</a> <br/> <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=62C881DB1CAC4A9296DF0E95BAEC26BC&amp;_z=z\">Bank Rakyat aims for more balanced portfolio</a> <p><br/> </p> <p><br/> </p>\r\n",

      "<p>FINALLY, the Audit Oversight Board (AOB) has imposed its first sanction. On July 12, more than two years after it had been set up, the board reprimanded Alvin Tee Guan Pian, the senior partner of accounting firm UHY Malaysia.</p><p>The AOB only provided a brief description of the breach: “Failure to comply with the relevant requirements of the recognised auditing standards in Malaysia i.e. the International Standards on Auditing.”</p><p>Tee was penalised because he was the engagement partner in the audit of a public interest entity (PIE) for the financial year ended July 31, 2010. It appears that the breach had to do with the way the audit was conducted.</p><p>Apart from listed companies, PIEs include banking and financial institutions (including Islamic banks and development financial institutions), insurance companies and takaful operators, and holders of Capital Market Services Licences (such as securities and futures trading firms, and fund management companies).</p><p>The AOB's refusal to reveal more about why Tee deserved a reprimand invites us to play the guessing game. Which of the many International Standards on Auditing applies in this case? And in what way exactly did Tee fail to comply with the auditing standard or standards? Why did this merit a sanction?</p><p>It was UHY that threw some light on this matter through a press release it issued on July 16 in response to a StarBiz report on the reprimand.</p><p>The firm's explanation is that there is a clash of opinions on whether it was right to believe that the PIE was a going concern back when its 2010 accounts were audited.</p><p>Said the press release: “UHY elaborated that the particular PIE was merely undergoing a recapitalisation exercise, where the focus on UHY's decision to concur with its client's going concern assumption' has been an area that the AOB differs in terms of its technical view of the matter. UHY believes it has strong grounds to appeal the AOB decision as the differing views are judgemental in nature.”</p><p>A fundamental principle in the preparation of financial statements, the going concern assumption simply means that the management of an organisation has no reason to believe that the organisation's operations will come to a halt in the foreseeable future.</p><p>When doing an audit, the auditor has to decide whether the use of the going concern assumption is appropriate.</p><p>The AOB has not responded to the UHY statement, although when speaking to StarBiz earlier, AOB executive chairman Nik Mohamed Hasyudeen Yusoff took pains to point out that the reprimand didn't mean that the PIE's 2010 accounts didn't give a true and fair view of the PIE's financial position and performance.</p><p>Instead, he added, the reprimand was because the auditor failed to do what was necessary in performing the audit.</p><p>But what was it that wasn't done? We won't know until the AOB and UHY decide to say more.</p><p>Meanwhile, it's useful to look at the AOB's annual reports for 2010 and 2011, which talk about issues concerning the going concern assumption that were uncovered when the board reviewed the audit work of some firms.</p><p>In 2010, the AOB highlighted several weaknesses in this area, such as auditors not doing enough to assess the appropriateness of the going concern assumption although there were signs of going concern issues; lack of evidence that the auditors had challenged key assumptions used by management to support the basis for going concern; and a majority of auditors failing to perform an independent stress test or sensitivity analysis.</p><p>The board then became specific: “In three instances, there were disclosures in the financial statements or management's representation letter which point to significant doubt or dependence of a future event to support their ability to continue operating as going concern entities. However, the audit opinion did not reflect the substance of such disclosures.</p><p>“In another instance, while an Emphasis of Matter' opinion relating to going concern was issued, the description of the facts supporting the opinion gave a different connotation as though there was no default in debt obligations.</p><p>Some of these issues observed in the 2010 inspections persisted the following year, judging from the comments in the AOB's annual report 2011.</p><p>“The AOB reiterates the need for assessing the fundamental assumptions of going concern made by management in the preparation of financial statements. Audit firms need to improve in this area as our inspection revealed that the performance of audit procedures is generally lacking,” said the board in the latest annual report.</p><p>“It is important to acknowledge that going concern considerations involve risks of key judgment area especially when the management's assessment may not be realistic.”</p><p>Clearly, this is an area that calls for professional scepticism, something that auditors are expected to exercise in spades in the course of their work.</p><p>There is no easy way to determine how sceptical an auditor should be in assessing the appropriateness of the use of the going concern assumption, but the AOB reprimand last week suggests that an intimate knowledge of the International Standards on Auditing is always desirable.</p><p>&gt; Executive editor Errol Oh was told that professional scepticism is in short supply, but he doesn't believe it.  </p>\r\n",

      "<p>PETALING JAYA: After operating for more than two years, the Audit Oversight Board (AOB) has finally wielded its powers of sanction. The senior partner of a mid-tier accounting firm is the first auditor to be penalised for breaching a condition imposed when he registered with the board.</p><p>Last Thursday, Alvin Tee Guan Pian of UHY Malaysia was reprimanded for “failure to comply with the relevant requirements of the recognised auditing standards in Malaysia i.e. the International Standards on Auditing”.</p><p>This information was posted on the Securities Commission (SC) website but no press release was issued to publicise this enforcement action.</p><p>According to the online update, Tee was the engagement partner in the audit of a public interest entity (PIE) for the financial year ended July 31, 2010.</p><p>The engagement partner is responsible for the performance of an audit and for the audit report issued after the work is done. The breach was in respect of this particular audit.</p><p>AOB executive chairman Nik Mohamed Hasyudeen Yusoff told StarBiz that this matter was picked up during the board's regular inspection process but he declined to provide more details of the contravention.</p><p>The board then conducted an inquiry and issued a show-cause letter.</p><p>Nik Hasyudeen said the decision to reprimand Tee took into account the inquiry findings and recommendation, Tee's response to the show-cause letter, and UHY's remedial measures.</p><p>However, Nik Hasyudeen pointed out the reprimand is not a reflection of the credibility of the accounts audited by UHY.</p><p>“This doesn't mean that the financial statements do not give a true and fair view (of the PIE's financial position and performance). The reprimand is because the auditor failed to do what was necessary in performing the audit,” he explained.</p><p>This is why the AOB has not named the PIE whose 2010 audit was at the heart of this case.</p><p>Following amendments to the SC Act 1993, the AOB began operations in April 2010 to oversee the auditors of PIEs and to promote confidence in the quality and reliability of the PIEs' audited financial statements.</p><p>PIEs include listed companies, banking and financial institutions (including Islamic banks and development financial institutions), insurance companies and takaful operators, and holders of Capital Market Services Licences (such as securities and futures trading firms, and fund management companies).</p><p>A major part of the board's work is the annual registration of audit firms and individual auditors, who are the firms' partners or sole properietors.</p><p>Including Tee, UHY has three individual auditors on the AOB's register, and the firm is the external auditor of almost 20 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia.</p><p>Previously, the AOB has relied on other enforcement measures in response to lapses by firms and auditors.</p><p>For example, when five firms accepted appointments in 2010 as auditors of PIEs without first registering with the board, they were given show-cause letters followed by warning letters.</p><p>Last year, when the AOB found shortcomings while reviewing some audit jobs, it shortened the tenure of registration for the three engagement partners from the usual one year to six months.</p><p>The SC Act provides for a range of “administrative-type” sanctions by the AOB such as the imposition of certain conditions, suspension, fines, reprimands, compulsory professional education, prohibition from accepting PIE clients or auditing PIEs' accounts, and deregistration.</p><p>While some may deem a reprimand a soft option among the sanctions, Nik Hasyudeen said: “We don't necessarily consider a reprimand a light form of enforcement action.</p><p>“Any action from our side is a serious thing.”</p><p>An AOB sanction is subject to an appeal to the SC within 30 days from the date of notification of the decision.</p><p>Tee has not responded to an e-mail from StarBiz asking for his comment on the reprimand.</p><p>According to a March 2012 press release, UHY in Malaysia is a partnership with four offices and more than 100 professionals.</p><p>It is part of the UHY international network of independent accounting and consulting firms.</p>\r\n",

It will find out what they are doing,'' said Pong. “They ought to be monitored closely, especially if the holding company is also to get a piece of action.''</p><p>In monitoring these non-bank institutions, certain areas such as lending to civil servants, may be the focus. “Excessive lending may, at some point, lead to a credit trap where these civil servants use up all their money to service their loans via salary deductions.'' said Pong. “They may then turn to other sources of borrowing.''</p><p>In many instances, loose credit standards and lack of credit analysis can also lead to other problems.</p><p>Recently, the activities and size of assets of these non-bank lenders have expanded. “The growth in financing extended has been mainly focused on the household sector but continues to represent a small share (5.9%) of total financing to households,'' said Bank Negara in its financial stability report.</p><p>“To ensure that these developments do not, over time, contribute towards the imprudent build-up of leverage in the household sector, the central bank's surveillance of developments in the lending activities by non-bank lenders has been strengthened in close cooperation with the relevant supervisory authorities.</p><p>“Specific measures have also been implemented to ensure that credit co-operative societies and large building societies observe responsible financing practices that are consistent with regulations applied to the financial institutions under the bank's purview,'' said Bank Negara.</p><p>In March, Malaysian Rating Corp (MARC) expressed concern that the pace of lending by non-bank institutions, for example, development financial institutions such as Bank Pembangunan, Bank Kerjasama Rakyat and Bank Simpanan Nasional, had been relatively high in the past few years.</p><p>It has averaged 14.5% a year since 2005 and moderated to 7.2% in 2011.</p><p>In voicing its concerns over the quantity and quality of loans given out, MARC had pointed out that lending for “consumption credit” had grown at a compounded average growth rate (CAGR) of 20.3% a year in the past seven years with the pace of growth in the lending for the credit cards segment, which has seen a CAGR of 50.4% a year since 2005.</p><p>In its financial sector blueprint, Bank Negara spoke of the development of a framework for monitoring and managing risks arising from entities and activities taking place outside the directly supervised financial system.</p><p>The steps involve enhancing data collection and surveillance of such entities and activities particularly those of systemic importance and implementing appropriate regulatory responses to preemptively manage emerging risks.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>NON-BANK lenders appear to be unperturbed by the introduction of stringent lending guidelines as their client base is different and they have internal targets to meet.</p><p>According to an industry observer, non-bank lenders like cooperatives, certain development financial institutions (DFIs) and Malaysian Building Society Bhd (MBSB) have a huge client base comprising mainly civil servants, and their targets are not solely determined by market forces.</p><p>The Responsible Financing Guidelines which took effect from Jan 1 are to control household debt, and banks have to approve loans based on the borrower's net income rather than gross income. This has resulted in some analysts lowering the loan growth and earning projections for banks.</p><p>Malaysian Rating Corp Bhd chief economist Nor Zahidi Alias hopes that cooperatives and DFIs would operate in line with the lending guidelines as well to ensure that there is no over-lending by these non-bank institutions.</p><p>Statistics reveal that the rate of lending from DFIs to certain segments like consumption credit has been very rapid since 2005, averaging 24.4% per annum. More astounding was the lending for credit cards which rose at a robust pace of 50.4% on a compound annual growth rate basis, rising from barely RM33mil to RM566mil  in six years.</p><p>This year, MBSB is looking at a loan growth of over 20%, driven by its personal financing and corporate loan portfolios. Chief executive Datuk Ahmad Zaini Othman recently said it was targeting between RM8bil and RM9bil of new personal financing this year compared with RM7bil last year.</p><p>The new financing guidelines, he said, would have little impact on MBSB, adding that it had observed a lot of the guidelines. He was quoted as saying that “although we are not compelled to follow the guidelines, at the working level, we follow the spirit of the guidelines.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Phillip Capital Management Sdn Bhd in its recent note after attending MBSB's fourth quarter results for 2011, said the management of  MBSB  had said it had no plans to slow down disbursements this year even if targets were met earlier, unlike last year where disbursements were consciously slowed down in the fourth quarter of last year once the target was met, and in anticipation of new products to be introduced this year.</p><p>To recap, MBSB's net profit for the financial year ended Dec 31 (FY2011) surged 123% year-on-year to RM325mil, bulk of which was underpinned by higher income from its Islamic banking operation via the expansion of personal financing.</p><p>The research house has called for a buy for MBSB as it continued to deliver new record earnings and persistent solid loan growth. Despite its superior net interest margins (company's target of at least 4% in FY2012 compared with FY2011 of 4.66%) and loan growth above the banking industry average (where consensus expects loan growth to be 6%-11% in FY2012), it believed MBSB would surprise the market with its first quarter results in two months time.</p><p>Phillip Capital also noted that it was upbeat about MBSB as it had managed to secure approvals from the federal and various state accountant-generals (AGs) to use the AG's direct salary deduction code for personal loans taken by government staff.</p><p>The cost of running an AG code is cheaper with only RM1 per transaction compared with 1.5% commission for each deduction to be charged by Angkasa. Commercial banks are currently barred from using the AG code, it noted.</p><p>Angkasa is the apex cooperative for all cooperatives in Malaysia and has been authorised to deduct civil servants' salaries directly for loan repayment through its division Biro Perkhidmatan Angkasa (BPA). Borrowers' monthly salaries are deducted by the respective government departments and channelled to BPA, which then transfers the monthly instalments to the cooperatives.</p><p>Non-bank lenders including MBSB are also likely to benefit from the civil servants' salary increases of between 7% and 13% under an improved Malaysian Remuneration System, according to analysts.</p><p>Early this month, the Government said it was scrapping the New Remuneration Scheme for civil servants (SBPA) and the existing Malaysian Remuneration System would be reintroduced with some enhancements. The previous SBPA was met with criticism from government employees who claimed that the scheme awarded salary increases that benefited higher ranking civil servants.</p><p>Inter-Pacific Securities Sdn Bhd head of research Pong Teng Siew feels the lending guidelines will affect the profitability of DFIs and MBSB as they have been included when the central bank circulated the guidelines to financial institutions to prevent regulatory arbitrage.</p><p>Pong says Bank Negara governor Tan Sri Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz has given notice that she will look next at extending these guidelines to the shadow banking system  non-bank lenders/non-depository financial institutions like leasing companies, credit companies and retail credit organisations  although no time frame had been set.</p><p>In response to a query from  StarBizWeek on its loan growth in view of the lending guidelines, Bank Rakyat says it expects its financing growth to be around 9% mainly driven by consumer financing. Currently, its financing portfolio mix is about 90% consumer financing and the rest from the commercial financing.</p><p>In its 2011 financial results briefing, Bank Rakyat said it was targeting to grow its net profit to RM2.1bil amid the sluggish economic environment and tighter banking guidelines.</p>\r\n",

This include stricter loan-to-value (LTV) ratios on the purchase of a second residential property (if such purchases are made within a specific time period), a further increase in capital charge in the computation of risk weighted assets (in areas which may be perceived to be at risk of a developing property bubble) and maximum portfolio concentration limits for certain classes of lending such as unsecured personal lending and credit card advances.</p><p>For this year, MARC's GDP growth projection was 4.4% while its forecast for 2013 stands at 5%. The central bank was targeting a GDP growth rate of between 4% and 5% this year.</p>\r\n",

Home loans remained the largest component, contributing about 45% of the total household debt, she added.</p><p>However, unsecured financing in the form of personal loans and credit-cards had been growing rapidly, accounting for about 15% and 5% of total household debt, respectively.</p><p>Development financial institutions, cooperatives and building societies that offer personal financing facilities to civil servants under salary-deduction schemes contributed to the bulk of the growth, she noted.</p><p>“We view positively Bank Negara’s various pre-emptive measures implemented since late 2010 to rein in growth in household debt and safeguard the soundness of the financial system.</p><p>“On top of the tighter measures on residential property financing, stricter guidelines have also been implemented on credit cards, such as increasing the income eligibility criteria.</p><p>“We do not discount additional prudential regulations to be imposed in future,” Wong said.</p><p>Effective Jan 1, banks are required to use net income calculation method instead of gross income when computing debt-service ratio.</p><p>Wong added that unemployment rate was still relatively low at 3% and the credit quality of household sector was also healthy, with a low gross impaired-loan ratio of 1.8% as at end-January 2012 (end-2010:2.3%).</p><p>Nevertheless, she said the debt-servicing ability of households in the lower-income segment might be more vulnerable to economic down-cycles, greater variability in income and inflationary pressures.</p><p>On loan growth, RAM Ratings expects the overall banking system’s loan growth to taper to about 8% to 9% this year, after clocking in a strong 14% expansion in 2011. This is supported by a projected 4.6% real GDP growth this year, which is slightly lower than the 5% in 2011.</p><p>Private investments, she said were expected to remain strong, although a weakening in global demand would have some bearing on export performance.</p><p>Wong anticipates the central bank to remain accommodative in its monetary policy by maintaining the overnight policy rate at 3% with a downside bias in 2012, as preserving growth momentum would take precedence over curbing inflationary pressures.</p><p>While a more moderate household loan growth was anticipated due to the prudential regulations introduced, she added this would be balanced by stronger financing demand from the commercial and corporate sector from the rollout of projects under the Economic Transformation Programme and 10th Malaysia Plan.</p><p>For non-performing loans this year, she said the industry’s gross impaired-loan ratio was expected to be kept healthy this year, with a slight uptick to about 3% from the current all time low level of 2.7%.</p><p>“In terms of capitalisation, all the domestic, all the domestic banks were well poised to meet the new capital requirements under Basel III, of which the implementation would be phased in from 2013,” she added.</p><p>Although these new capital measures would elevate banks’ funding costs, which may in turn be passed on to consumers, it would ensure the banking sector was safeguarded against unexpected shocks, Wong said.</p><p>As at end-January, the banking system’s capitalisation was strong with a tier-1 risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio of 12.9%.</p><p>Banks’ profitability, she said had been on a steady rise over the last couple of years on the back of strong loan growth, benign loan impairment charges and growing fee income. However, net interest margins (NIMs) had been under pressure due to stiff price competition, particularly in certain loan segments such as residential mortgages.</p><p>NIM is a measure of the difference between interest income generated by banks and interest paid out to depositors.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>PETALING JAYA: The Audit Oversight Board (AOB) has flexed its regulatory muscles in a surprising way when it shortened the tenure of registration for three partners of two accounting firms from the usual one year to six months. Although by no means the harshest action that the board can take, this reduction of the validity period of registration serves notice that the work of auditors of large companies is indeed under greater scrutiny than before.</p><p>This measure came after the board's inspection last year of the country's six biggest audit firms  PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, Ernst &amp; Young, Deloitte, BDO and Crowe Horwath. Two of the three partners are from Crowe Horwath, while the third is from Ernst &amp; Young. They were registered for six months instead of 12 because the AOB found certain shortcomings while reviewing the audit jobs in which the trio were involved as engagement partners.</p><p>(An audit engagement partner is the person responsible for the performance of an audit and for the audit report issued after the work is done.)</p><p>The rationale for the shorter registration tenure for the three individual auditors is so that they will go through an earlier re-evaluation than the rest, to determine if there are improvements in the audits under their watch.</p><p>Under the Section 31S of the Securities Commission Act 1993, the period of registration with the AOB or the renewal is for 12 months, but the board has the discretion to specify otherwise.</p><p>AOB executive chairman Nik Mohd Hasyudeen Yusoff said the decision to halve the registration period for the auditors was based on its observations during the inspections of their firms last year.</p><p>He added: “We feel that we need to send a signal that the auditors must improve themselves. We want the firms to be very serious about maintaining audit quality. We shortened the registration period because we are timing the next inspections to happen before the respective six-month period is up. We will look at their job performance, and if they have improved, we will put them back on the normal arrangements.”</p><p>On why the AOB focused on the partners instead of their firms, he explained that the board's inspections showed that the firms had put in place the required process and controls. “The other part is when the individual auditors perform their work. As engagement partners, they take responsibility. From our viewpoint and after deliberation at the board level, this is the right measure to take in these particular situations based on the facts of these cases. If we had felt that the issues were more of a systemic nature, we would have looked at the firms,” he said.</p><p>He pointed out that shortcomings identified in the inspections related to non-compliance with some aspects of the international auditing standards in the performance of the relevant audits, but these did not invalidate the audit opinions expressed on the financial statements.</p><p>Crowe Horwath Malaysia managing partner Poon Yew Hoe said the firm had 20 partners. The registration of all of them were renewed accordingly, except for the two whose registration were renewed for six months.</p><p>“We are not aware of any specific reasons for the six-month renewal and will be working closely with the AOB to ensure all our partners remain registered with the board at all times. As integrity remains one of our core values, Crowe Horwath is committed to observing and adopting the highest level of auditing and ethical standards,” he added.</p><p>In a statement issued to StarBizWeek, Ernst &amp; Young said it welcomed the findings and comments in the AOB's inaugural annual report released on March 31. Added the firm: “The AOB has acknowledged that the audit firms inspected had put in place systems and procedures in line with global best practices. However, there are some specific areas for improvement.”</p><p>However, the firm declined to comment on the six-month renewal of its partner's registration, pending clarification from the AOB.</p><p>The AOB commenced operations on April 1 last year and immediately began registering audit firms and individual auditors. At the year-end, 83 firms and 310 individual auditors were on the board's register of auditors.</p><p>The six firms covered in last year's inspections were chosen because they collectively audited 73% of the public interest entities (PIEs) in Malaysia, while their listed clients accounted for 93% of the total market capitalisation of the companies on Bursa Malaysia. PIEs include listed companies, banking and financial institutions (including Islamic banks and development financial institutions), insurance companies and takaful operators, and holders of Capital Market Services Licences (such as securities and futures trading firms, and fund management companies).</p><p>This year, the AOB plans to inspect the six largest firms again, plus 12 others.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>PETALING JAYA: Financial institutions believe that personal financing, although on the rise, is not a cause for concern as it still constitutes a lesser segment of the total household debt.</p><p>RHB Bank Bhd acting director of retail banking Vince Au Yoong told StarBiz that although personal financing expanded by 29.4% last year, the outstanding balance accounted for less than 5% of total household debts.</p><p>“Additionally, almost half of the household debts were from long term secured borrowings to fund house acquisitions of about 46.2% in 2009,” he said.</p><p>Personal loan, as one of the components of household debts, has a been a topic of concern among some economists who worry that growth seen in consumer spending may have been a result of debt instead of income growth.</p><p>Personal loans was up 14.3% in March from a year ago and 1.9% higher than February.</p><p>Last year, according to Bank Negara, outstanding personal financing grew by 17.5% to account for 14.6% of household debt, compared with 9.6% in 2006.</p><p>It was reported that development financial institutions, cooperatives and building societies constitute the bulk of this growth, with almost 80% granted under salary deduction schemes.</p><p>Meanwhile, OCBC Bank (M) Bhd country chief risk officer Choo Yee Kwan said typical of emerging or newly emerging economies, rising wealth of the working population might bring about a rise in household debt, of which the key components would very likely be housing and transportation-related needs.</p><p>“Although on the uptrend, personal financing constitutes a relatively lesser segment of the nation's total household debt,” he said.</p><p><a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=MBSB\" target=\"_blank\">Malaysia Building Society Bhd</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=MBSB\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a> (MBSB) chief executive officer Datuk  Ahmad Zaini Othman said the rise of personal financing reflected that more customers were in need of cash to meet their personal financial needs.</p><p>“We must look at the rising costs of living, costs of goods and services, costs of medical, education and others. We must then compare that to the low incremental of wages over the years.</p><p>“Simply, the growth rate of household income has been lower than that of household expenditure over the last few decades.</p><p>“Hence, customers are left with no options but to take personal financing to meet non-recurring expenditure such as their parents' medical fees and hospitalisation, children's education, house improvements and long term retail investments.</p><p>“As long as financial institutions continue to provide responsible lending to financially qualified customers, this may not be a critical concern,” he said.</p><p>Ahmad Zaini also pointed out that up until 2009, MBSB had only been disbursing a monthly average of RM15mil of personal financing, hence, the statement that building societies' was a key contributor to the growth of personal financing (since 2006) was inaccurate.</p><p>“The cooperatives on the other hand have been able to provide a significant amount of personal financing to their members/government servants due to their collaborations over the years with the commercial banks.</p><p>“The commercial banks are actually the financiers,” he said.</p><p>On demand and promotions of personal loans have been getting more competitive of late, Au Yong said previously there was a big group of those under-served, where financing was not easily accessible.</p><p>“As a result, they have to obtain financing from private enterprises or unorganised groups who charge exorbitant rates as this group were perceived as high risks.</p><p>“But, with robust risk management tools, banks are able to better serve this huge segment. On top of this, customers are able to build their credit history that will help them to obtain better pricing in the future,” he said.</p><p>Going forward, Au Yong said personal loan was one of the bank's key retail products.</p><p>“We have a strong demand for this product and the overall portfolio is performing well. Hence, we will continue to offer personal loans in the marketplace,” he said.</p><p>Choo said with the positive economic outlook this year and OCBC's strong capital position, its risk appetite remained intact and would invest in good business propositions to grow its loan book.</p><p>“Personal loans provide an alternative to other personal financial management tools such as credit cards and overdraft facilities, which offer different platforms for customers to manage their spending and credit needs prudently, within their means of repayment,” he said.</p><p>Ahmad Zaini said MBSB aimed to achieve loan growth in all its existing products including personal financing.</p><p>“The customers are certainly appreciative of very affordable financing being offered resulting in the good response received, hence to deny or limit the access will only result in unfavourable circumstances for them.</p><p>“It may also cause them to turn to unlicensed parties for financing,” he said.</p><p>Related Stories:  Amended Act likely to affect used car sales   Govt's active role in social housing vital   Small impact seen after banks' rates rise</p>\r\n",

      "<p>THE banking landscape, which has gone through considerable reform and consolidation, is set for exciting changes  again. This time, it will be driven by bigger players that aim, through a market-driven process, to gain further strength and traction as competition intensifies.</p><p>With the process of liberalisation well under way, the competition comes from all sides as different sets of players emerge. Apart from the fight in the traditional retail market, new entrants are tapping the global, commercial, Islamic, wholesale and investment banking space.</p><p>On the corporate level, bank mergers and acquisitions are coming alive again with Hong Leong Bank leading the charge through its recent acquisition of EON Bank.</p><p>In fact, a number of bank stakes are up for sale. Dubbed banking consolidation round three, the resulting combinations will be keenly watched.</p><p>   M&amp;A scenarios</p><p>The hottest deal now is the sale of the 25% stake held by the Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB) in RHB Capital Bhd. So far, three to four parties have submitted their bids for the stake for which the asking price is said to be around two times book value or RM10 per share.</p><p>At RHB, the talk on M&amp;A revolves around two elements  sale of the ADCB stake and even RHB itself.</p><p>Speculation on a possible RHB/CIMB merger has resurfaced. It was first mentioned as part of a game plan when CIMB took over Southern Bank Bhd, and RHB was seen as the next potential takeover target for CIMB.</p><p>The rumours on a possible RHB/CIMB merger were stoked following a recent statement by CIMB chief Datuk Seri Nazir Razak on its ambition to be among the top three in Asia in terms of market capitalisation.</p><p>No doubt there will be duplication in the investment and corporate banking business, but that is seen to be the fastest route to the top among Malaysian banks in terms of market capitalisation.</p><p>Some analysts consider CIMB to be strong enough to do another merger, following its merger with Southern Bank five to six years ago.</p><p>The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) which holds a 45% stake in RHB Capital, will be looking at a compelling price and reason to sell, having put the bank on a firmer foothold and doubled its profits.</p><p>Another statement that had the market talking was the Prime Minister's statement that he might consider a higher stake in <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=AMBANK\" target=\"_blank\">AMMB Holdings Bhd</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=AMBANK\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a> by the Australia New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) which currently has a 24% stake.</p><p>“There's no smoke without a fire.'' says an analyst. Reports had speculated that AMMB chairman Tan Sri Azman Hashim, who indirectly holds a 17% stake, may be looking to sell out.</p><p>The limit on foreign shareholding in banks is 30% but applications for stakes exceeding that threshold may be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>ANZ is reported to be one of the potential bidders for the ADCB block; if ANZ succeeds in buying a stake in RHB, it would need to merge AMMB with RHB, analysts noted.</p><p>Another potential M&amp;A may be from the <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=AFG\" target=\"_blank\">Alliance Financial Group</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=AFG\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a> (AFG), whose strategic shareholder, Langkah Bahagia, is looking to exit. Langkah Bahagia effectively owns 14.8% of AFG via Vertical Theme which is a joint venture between Langkah Bahagia (51%) and Temasek (41%) that collectively owns 29% of AFG.</p><p>DBS is reported to be another bidder for the stake in ADCB. If it does buy into RHB Capital, AFG could be merged with RHB or Temasek could sell off its stake in AFG.  </p><p>Push factors</p><p>The relatively saturated domestic banking market is a natural push factor for larger banks to sustain and expand their dominance locally, notes Malaysian Rating Corp Bhd (MARC) vice-president and head of financial institution ratings Anandakumar Jegarasasingam.</p><p>As for smaller banks, consolidation within themselves will help to ensure such an exercise takes place on their own terms.</p><p>“The business of banking has evolved into one where economies of scale in funding and lending activities is of great importance, thus acquisitions are preferred over organic growth by those seeking to enlarge their franchise,'' he says.</p><p>“Ambitions of certain banking groups to achieve regional flagship status require the creation of a stronger domestic franchise that can, in turn, support their regional ventures,'' he explains.</p><p>Thinning margins also force banks to look for efficiencies; in Malaysia, the margin is said to be around 3% compared with Singapore (2.5%) and Indonesia (5%).</p><p>Yvonne Chia, group managing director of Hong Leong Bank, expects the fight for profitable market segments to intensify in Malaysia.</p><p>“The banks will need to address the challenging task of adopting risk-based pricing along Basle lines in a very liquid and low interest rate environment where the price war remains unabated,'' she tells StarBizWeek.</p><p>The war for talent is unrelenting and will continue. Return on shareholders' funds of banks is increasingly under pressure with additional  capital  requirements under Basle 2/3.</p><p>“The need for scale efficiency, fee income, balance sheet and capital strength and deposit liquidity further powers the shift to consolidate, to capitalise on combined market coverage, talent and benefits of scale.</p><p>“Additional scale allows investment and encourage innovative business models to serve evolving market needs.  In essence, it allows already successful franchises to take the business to the next level,'' says Chia.   </p><p>Too big to fail?</p><p>Many who recall big banks in the West crashing during the recent financial crisis will ask: “When will they ever learn that big is not always beautiful?''</p><p>In fact, big banks may be less nimble and innovative. In extreme cases, their formation may lead to cartelisation, to the detriment of consumers.</p><p>However, that tendency could be limited as banks compete heavily against each other, an analyst points out. While in the area of mortgage loans, the rates are getting cheaper, it is noted that rates for credit cards stay consistently high among all the banks.</p><p>Analysts caution against systemic risk if the largest banks merge to form banks that can be deemed “too big to fail”.</p><p>“In the US, that threshold is 10% of loans. However,  in the Malaysian context, there is already a high concentration of assets in the largest banks in Malaysia,'' says an analyst.</p><p>However, in the consolidation process, Bank Negara would be in a position to decide which mergers are in the best interest of the banking sectors and the economy in general, he adds.</p><p>Analysts view that consolidation generally results in better pricing, cheaper cost of funds as well as product reach.</p><p>As margins narrow with higher competition, banks are likely to come up with more products to earn more money, thus giving better choices to consumers.</p><p>“If the partner and chemistry are right, the M&amp;A can work,'' says an analyst, pointing to the two major ones that have worked  CIMB and Southern Bank in the retail space; the tie-up between AMMB with ANZ has resulted in profitability.</p><p>In some instances, for example, the card business, the merger between CIMB and Southern Bank has seen improved service levels, says an analyst.</p><p>“Eventually, there will be probably four or five banking groups,'' says Tan Sri Azlan Zainol, chairman of RHB Bank. “The consolidation will be driven by those with strong capital base, strong shareholders and the need to expand regionally.''</p><p>The management should not be restricted to just local talent. “We need the best,'' Azlan says. “We should not be too restrictive but look into hiring foreigners.''</p><p>According to  Jegarasasingam, there is considerable fragmentation of market share among the smaller banks, with the three large local banks accounting for nearly 40%-45% of assets in the Malaysian banking sector.</p><p>The three small local banks (including EON Bank, which has since been acquired by Hong Leong Bank) account for only 7%-8% of banking sector assets.</p><p>Consolidation of Hong Leong and EON Bank will enable both groups to reach out to a larger customer base and most segments, with a broader range of products, services and solutions to reach out to over 300 branches and 1,200 self-service terminals.</p><p>“With the combined Hong Leong/EON Bank, we reassert our strong position in the retail segment. For the business segment, we have doubled up our market share, making us a more pre-eminent player. Internally, it will augment career opportunities for our employees with a larger and growing Hong Leong group riding on strong growth ambitions,'' Chia tells StarBizWeek.</p><p>The customer will also benefit as evolving market trends that include mass adoption of portable devices, mobile interaction and social networks point to the need to offer more relevant, integrated and seamless solutions and offerings.</p><p>   Not a shrinking pie</p><p>Consolidation usually refers to shrinkage. And while the local pie is shrinking via this consolidation process, licences are issued to a host of global, commercial and Islamic banks from overseas.</p><p>According to Chia, these moves to consolidate and at the same time, expand certain niches, are specifically targeted.</p><p>“There are new segments that are under-served and a need to cater for the changes arising from Asean integration as well as the rise of India and China as more important trading partners.</p><p>In the investment banking space, the expansion from universal broker status has led to the creation of six non-bank backed investment banks alongside the existing nine bank-backed arms.</p><p>According to U Chen Hock, CEO of OSK Investment Bank, finding its own niche and achieving scale through regional operations is a primary way to sustain this new growth area.</p><p>The setting up of new Islamic banks also represented another dynamic growth area in the banking sector.</p><p>About 30 new banking franchises have been created and these include locally incorporated foreign banks, investment banks, Islamic banks and international Islamic banks, says Promod Das, head of financial institution ratings at RAM Ratings.</p><p>The regional theme will ensure expansion in businesses overseas. A few Malaysian banks are already making significant headways to seek growth outside Malaysia to tap the Asean growth and integration.</p><p>“Regional and cross-border investment, trade, foreign exchange and wealth flows will further accelerate the regionalisation imperative,'' says Chia.</p><p>Expansion in the banking sector is also via the e-equation' of mobile and online banking.</p><p>“The next generation of consumers expect easier and faster access to financial information with many expecting 24 /7, ubiquitous access.</p><p>“Providing digital age offerings will come under the spotlight and will redefine customer engagement and relationship management for the banking industry,'' says Chia of Hong Leong.</p><p>Datuk Seri Abdul Wahid Omar, president and CEO of Maybank, does not see these two trends  consolidation and expansion  as contradictory.</p><p>“The need for the banking industry to expand will be there as long as consumer and business demand grow to expand the economy and in turn it is the banking sector that also drives the economy,'' he says.</p><p>As Malaysia becomes a developed economy, it is the larger banks with their economies of scale and scope that will have the ability to provide a wider range of products and services at a lower cost.</p><p>“For this to happen, the industry will have to go through a consolidation phase where banks will grow not just organically but through acquisition of smaller banks,'' says Wahid.</p><p>The major issue is ensuring that the right banks are merged; there must be a business fit that complements each other with as little duplication as possible. Reducing this duplication will take time, given that retrenchments or relocation of employees could have regulatory restrictions as seen in the previous consolidation of 1999-2002, where banks were not allowed to retrench staff for two years following a merger.</p><p>“Experience has shown that banks can often see a decline in productivity upon a merger and in practice, mergers can take two to three years before they become value accretive, depending also on the valuation of the acquisition.</p><p>“In the interim, if investors see greater value elsewhere, the resulting depressed share price could have negative implications. for example, in raising capital,'' says an analyst.</p><p>Another issue for smaller banks in attracting foreign banks to become a strategic partner is that the limit on foreign shareholding could be a hindrance although this could be resolved on a case by case basis as indicated by Bank Negara.</p><p>Jegarasasingam of MARC cautions against small Malaysian banks from expanding into regional markets, which are generally risky and complex to manage.</p><p>In consolidation exercises, heavy competition among potential acquirers may, at times, result in a sub-standard due diligence exercise arising from the eagerness to close the deal ahead of competitors, he says.</p><p>”Any merger or acquisition should not merely be driven by attractive pricing. Such deals should also be evaluated in terms of the potential value proposition and the effort required for extracting results out of the deal.'' he adds.   </p><p>Future direction</p><p>With so many measures taken to boost Islamic banking, repositioning the banking system in the competitive global arena as the international Islamic financial centre has become a priority, says Promod.</p><p>He also expects some relaxation of foreign equity ownership in domestic banks, removal of some existing restrictions on locally incorporated foreign banks and the issuances of more licences that will encourage competition.</p><p>Currently, commercial and investment banking businesses are held under different legal entities in a universal banking group, he notes.</p><p>“There may be more flexibility to remove these regulatory walls in search of administrative efficiency.</p><p>“Bank Negara's next financial sector blueprint might also create regulatory and market undercurrents to consolidate the role of financial co-operatives and development financial institutions, an area which was not prioritised in the last financial sector master plan,' he says.</p><p>Promod does not discount the possibility of a shake-out in the stand-alone investment banking space.</p><p>“There clearly has emerged a huge gap in franchise between the large investment banking powerhouses that are part of universal banking groups and their much smaller stand-alone rivals.</p><p>“This fiercely competitive space naturally does not favour smaller players,'' he says.</p><p>Datuk Charon Wardini Mokhzani, corporate and investment banking deputy CEO of the <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=CIMB\" target=\"_blank\">CIMB Group</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=CIMB\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a>, however, feels there is room for different types of investment banks on a growing capital market.</p><p>Related Stories:  Little impact from foreign banking players   Challenge to sustain investment banking   Job creation and shortage of staff in financial services sector   More M&amp;As seen in insurance and takaful </p>\r\n",

      "<p>A lot is riding on the sturdiness of the Audit Oversight Board framework</p><p>WHOSE fault is it if the quality and reliability of audited financial statements in Malaysia suffer because the audit fees don't correspond to the amount and nature of work required to do a good job? This mismatch is a common complaint among the auditors. We often hear them lamenting that the fees in Malaysia are on the low side. For an example of this, read our Up Close &amp; Personal interview with KPMG Malaysia managing partner Mohamed Raslan Abdul Rahman on page 6.</p><p>The maiden annual report of the Audit Oversight Board (AOB), issued on Thursday, has amplified the issue. When highlighting the key findings from its inspections of the six largest audit firms in the country, the board points out that auditors need to price their services at levels that will ensure that they can comply with the requirements of auditing and ethical standards. The worry here is that firms may decide on the resources to be deployed for audit engagements based on the fees they will earn rather than on the risks that need to be addressed when auditing the accounts.</p><p>In its annual report, the AOB relays the grouse of audit firms that “due to the relatively low audit fees in Malaysia, it is a big challenge for them to secure adequate resources”. Considering that the AOB was set up to assist the Securities Commission in regulating auditors of public interest entities (PIEs), it's telling that the board saw this matter as worthy of a mention. But does this mean that the authorities agree that the auditors are not being paid enough for their services?</p><p>If you're bent on getting an unambiguous answer to that, good luck to you. The board will only go as far as to emphasise that the fees should be properly tied to the audit work that ought to be done. It says in the annual report: “The AOB is mindful that the global economy is still in a recovery stage. This will continue to place pressure on PIEs to contain their operating costs, including audit fees. Nevertheless, the AOB expects auditors to price their fees to commensurate with the risks undertaken so as not to compromise on audit quality.”</p><p>PIEs include listed companies, banking and financial institutions (including Islamic banks and development financial institutions), insurance companies and takaful operators, and holders of Capital Market Services Licences (such as securities and futures trading firms, and fund management companies).</p><p>When fielding questions from reporters after releasing the report, AOB executive chairman Mohamed Nik Hasyudeen Yusoff stopped short of endorsing the view that companies in Malaysia should get used to the idea of paying higher audit fees. He said the board would not tell the firms what to charge clients and would leave this to the market forces to decide. Instead, he urged companies to look at audit fees as an investment rather than as a cost, because the work of auditors supports the enhancement of a company's value.</p><p>To help audit firms in determining fees, the Malaysian Institute of Accountants have something called A Guide To Charging For Professional Assurance Services. It says: “Fee arrangement is a matter for commercial negotiation by practitioners. The Institute does not prescribe the mandatory basis for calculating fees, nor does it ordinarily investigate complaints relating solely to the quantum of fees charged.</p><p>“The level of fee is to be mutually agreed between the auditor and his client, which largely depends upon the skill and knowledge required, level of training and experience of the staff involved, the time necessarily occupied and the degree of responsibility and urgency of work involved.</p><p>“However, this RPG (recommended practice guide) is useful as a benchmark to establish the reasonable level of remuneration, commensurate with the provision of professional services of an acceptable and recognised standard in the absence of other more sophisticated billing methodology.”</p><p>The problem is, not many firms make full use of the RPG. Hence, we continue to hear the auditors' grumbling about the fees. Perhaps their best hope is that the AOB framework will bring about desirable changes.</p><p>The strategy here is that the AOB inspections will compel the firms to improve their compliance with the standards, and consequently, the firms will turn to their clients and say: “Look, we'll get into trouble with the regulators if our audit work falls short of the requirements of the standards. We won't cut corners and we won't reduce the scope of the work. Our fees have to be right-sized. If you don't want to pay that much, find auditors who are willing to risk being slapped with sanctions by the AOB.”</p><p>Of course, such a transition in mindset will take time. Meanwhile, let's see how the AOB handles the errant firms that has no qualms about bending the rules to fit the fees. The annual report has this to say: “It has been a known area of concern that the provision of non-audit services by audit firms to their listed audit clients may result in auditors low-balling their audit fees to gain more consulting jobs at clients and this may compromise independence. The AOB will be reviewing the safeguards in place to understand how the threats are mitigated.” Again, who should we blame for low-quality audits?</p><p> Deputy executive editor Errol Oh believes that many people don't understand what is it that auditors really do.</p>\r\n",

This raises the possibility of the board finding more areas of concern when it widens its inspection coverage to include smaller firms this year.</p><p>AOB executive chairman Nik Mohd Hasyudeen Yusoff said the board was targeting to inspect 18 audit firms this year, including mid-tier and small firms. “We will have a better picture of where everybody is in the (financial reporting) ecosystem,” he told reporters after the release of the AOB's maiden annual report yesterday.</p><p>He described the inspections and the resulting remediation as the most important part of the board's work. “This is where we try to influence the quality of audit, when we understand where the firms are lacking and where they can improve,” he said.</p><p>Last year, the AOB used a risk-based approach to select the six firms for inspection. These firms are the Big Four (PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, Ernst &amp; Young and Deloitte) and two others with more than 10 partners. The board did not name the latter, but according to its Register of Auditors, BDO and Crowe Horwath are the only firms apart from the Big Four that have more than 10 partners.</p><p>Nik Mohd Hasyudeen said these firms collectively audited 73% of the public interest entities (PIEs) in Malaysia, while their listed clients accounted for 93% of the total market capitalisation of the companies on Bursa Malaysia. PIEs include listed companies, banking and financial institutions (including Islamic banks and development financial institutions), insurance companies and takaful operators, and holders of Capital Market Services Licences (such as securities and futures trading firms, and fund management companies).</p><p>Said Nik Mohd Hasyudeen: “We have decided that the six firms will continue be inspected annually because of the impact of their work, whereas the others will each be inspected every three years. But that depends on what we find during the inspections, because we may have to conduct follow-up inspections.”</p><p>In his message in the annual report, he wrote: “While we determined that the audit firms inspected had put in place systems and processes in line with global best practices, some specific areas for improvements were identified. The AOB will follow up on the remediation efforts of the audit firms to ensure substantive changes are effected to enhance audit quality.”</p><p>The report said the inspections had identified a number of shortcomings that needed to be addressed by the firms, particularly in the area of audit documentation and evidence for significant judgement areas.</p><p>“If a firm doesn't document its work, there is no basis for us to confirm that the firm has performed its function. One of the principles that we have adopted in our inspections is that if you fail to document, we will consider that you have not done the audit procedure. This is a very strong position that we have taken,” added Nik Mohd Hasyudeen.</p><p>Said the AOB in the annual report: “Other than instances where there was insufficient documentation for the audit evidence obtained, there were instances where the necessary audit procedures and evidence were clearly not performed or obtained. It is pertinent to recognise that without sufficient evidence and analysis, the auditor may not have a basis to support their opinion.”</p><p>The board also called on the auditors to be more robust and to apply professional scepticism in challenging management assumptions and estimates, particularly in areas that require significant professional judgement such as in determining fair value, asset impairment and going concern.</p><p>He said these were highly subjective areas and pointed out that the value of the audit work came from the auditors exercising professional scepticism to objectively and independently arrive at audit opinions.</p><p>Another key observation by the AOB following last year's inspections was the need for audit firms to price their services at levels that commensurated with the risks undertaken so as not to compromise on audit quality.</p><p>The annual report also highlighted that human resource was an important factor in ensuring high quality audit, including ensuring appropriate workload of partners and other members of the audit team, as well as attracting new talent through a conducive work environment.</p><p>Nik Mohd Hasyudeen said the board had yet to determine if the issues uncovered in last year's inspection would lead to inquiries and possible sanctions. He explained: “Our main focus is to work with the firms on remediation. That is very critical. If we have identified areas for improvement, we need to get that resolved immediately rather than to prolong the situation. Given that we just completed the inspections in December, we are still looking at a number of issues. If we were to impose sanctions, we will be transparent.”</p>\r\n",

      "<p>THE build-up of household debt has been a topic that has generated much discussion in recent months and years.</p><p>Yes, the numbers do show household debt as a percentage of GDP rising and at the end of last year it was 75.9%. The worry is that it is the largest percentage rise in Asia and the memory of the consequences of uncontrolled build-up has been displayed in South Korea, where the unravelling of its credit card debt sent the economy southward.</p><p>Working in favour of the economy is that the debt build-up has been supported by household assets, which is more than twice that of total household debt.</p><p>Full employment, the high savings of Malaysians and low non-performing loans of household debt adds to the cushion for the regulator in assessing the overall situation with household debt and the potential systemic risk it poses.</p><p>In Bank Negara governor's statement in the Financial Stability and Payment Systems Report 2010, Tan Sri Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz says that while household indebtedness has increased in the recent years, it has continued to be supported by strong financial buffers at the aggregate level.</p><p>“Income growth, the high savings rate and favourable employment conditions have contributed to supporting the debt servicing capacity of households,” she says in her statement.</p><p>“To ensure that this does not become a source of financial instability, a comprehensive series of policies were introduced during the course of the year. These include prudential policies applied in the residential property sector, new credit card measures and strengthened requirements for banks to adopt prudent and responsible lending practices. This was reinforced by more intensive supervisory oversight of financial institutions with respect to the management of household lending portfolios,” she says.</p><p>The governor adds in her statement that more targeted financial education programmes as well as advisory and support arrangements have also served to promote responsible borrowing by households. These pre-emptive and more holistic measures also aim to contribute towards further strengthening the resilience of the household sector.</p><p>The central bank uses the Financial Stability Policy Committee, a forum that assess risks to financial stability.</p><p>The Financial Stability Policy Committee also works with the Monetary Policy Committee, which sets the overnight policy rate, in coming up with macroprudential responses for the economy.</p><p>Some examples how those committees have worked together has been the recent steps taken to put some brakes in household debt and consumption credit.</p><p>The central bank last year had imposed a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 70% for people wanting to buy their third or more homes.</p><p>Latest data do indicate demand for housing loans is starting to cool. Banks are paying more attention to applications of borrowers to weed out speculative borrowing but the impact will only be known in the March data to see if the drop is seasonal like it is at the beginning of any year.</p><p>The next measure Bank Negara took was to raise the minimum income limit to RM24,000 per annum for people to be eligible for a credit card. It is also limiting the number of credit cards to two for people earning less than RM36,000 a year.</p><p>The reason for worry for credit cards stemmed from the growing use of credit for transaction purposes.</p><p>Bank Negara says that despite a reduction in the number of cards owned by households following the imposition of a RM50 fee by the Government on credit cards in 2010, outstanding credit card balances increased by 15.2% to RM30.8bil at the end of last year to account for 5.3% of household debts. It further says that outstanding balances per credit card holder rose by 15.1% to RM9,516 as at end-2010.</p><p>“The number of credit card holders with revolving balances (excluding defaulters) accounted for 47.9% of total credit card holders. More than half of credit card holders with revolving balances were those earning an annual income of RM36,000 and below,” it says in the report.</p><p>Meanwhile, the level of non-performing loans (NPLs) ratio for credit cards issued by banks and non-banks remained low at 1.7%.</p><p>The next step Bank Negara is taking is to stress-test individual borrowers to gauge if they can afford a new loan once new guidelines are introduced in the third quarter of this year.</p><p>The new guidelines are designed to inculcate responsible lending practices by financial institutions when dealing with retail customers where borrowers will be subject to a suitability and affordability assessment and verification of income.</p><p>The reason for that is while there are education programmes to inform young borrowers about getting into debt and how to manage their finances, clamps need to be also put in place because the last thing anyone wants is a homegrown sub-prime crisis.</p><p>In tackling the affordability angle, one area where consumption credit in still left unchecked and unregulated is personal financing from development financial institutions (DFIs), cooperatives and building societies.</p><p>While a large fraction of household borrowings is collateralised, as 45.3% of such financing was for the purchase of residential properties, personal financing has increased significantly in recent periods.</p><p>Bank Negara says in 2010, outstanding personal financing grew by 17.5% to account for 14.6% of household debt (2006: 9.6%). DFIs, co-ops and building societies accounted for the bulk of this growth, with almost 80% granted under salary deduction schemes.</p><p>“Given the salary deduction feature, credit assessments by these institutions are mostly limited to a reliance on incomplete computations of debt-servicing ratios, which are applied for the purpose of qualifying for the salary deduction facility,” the central bank says. “The absence of robust credit and affordability assessments will result in households being more at risk of becoming over-indebted, while the risk of defaulting on financing obligations, including those obtained from other banking institutions, will be higher for borrowers who have over-borrowed.”</p><p>The central bank says excluding the DFIs, personal financing exposures of commercial banks increased at a lower rate of 13% to account for 8.6% of banking system household loans. Sound underwriting standards have largely been maintained by banks in terms of financing limits, tenures and pricing for these exposures.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>THE residential property market has been experiencing an upturn since the fourth quarter of 2009 as demand rebounded by 7.1% (2009: -2.3%) following improved consumer sentiments. Meanwhile, the increase in housing stock moderated in 2010 as housing started a declining trend.</p><p>The widening gap between supply and demand has kept property prices elevated, although at the national level, the Malaysian House Price Index rose only moderately by 6.2% up to the third quarter of 2010. Substantial increases in house prices had been observed in selected locations within and surrounding the urban areas where price increases were up to four times higher than the national house price index.</p><p>Price increases in these locations have in turn resulted in prices of properties in the surrounding locations to increase, making homeownership increasingly less affordable for the average Malaysian. There have also been incidents of applications for financing of multiple residential units within a single development project from a single borrower.</p><p>To address this development, borrowers are subjected to a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 70% for the third and subsequent house financing facilities with effect from Nov 3, 2010. This measure aims to promote a stable and sustainable property market by deterring speculative activity through higher equity requirements for transactions of these nature.</p><p>In January 2011, Bank Negara revised the risk weights applied under the capital adequacy framework from 75% to 100% for housing loans with LTVs exceeding 90% to further reinforce prudent underwriting practices.</p><p>While a large fraction of household borrowings was collateralised (45.3% was for the purchase of residential properties), personal financing had increased significantly as outstanding personal financing grew by 17.5% to account for 14.6% of household debt last year (2006: 9.6%).</p><p>Development financial institutions (DFIs), cooperatives and building societies accounted for the bulk of this growth, with almost 80% granted under salary-deduction schemes.

Similarly, outstanding balances per credit cardholder rose by 15.1% to RM9,516 as at end-2010. The number of credit card holders with revolving balances (excluding defaulters) accounted for 47.9% of total credit cardholders.</p><p>More than half of credit cardholders with revolving balances were those earning an annual income of RM36,000 and below. Meanwhile, the level of non-performing loan (NPL) ratio for credit cards issued by banks and non-banks remained low at 1.7%. To ensure that credit card debts are maintained at manageable levels, a number of pre-emptive measures have been introduced, including raising minimum income eligibility, limiting the number of credit card ownership and aggregate credit limit for those with annual income of RM36,000 and below.</p><p>Loans-in-arrears across most categories of household debts remained stable, while loans-in-arrears for personal financing, which drifted upwards in the early part of last year, started to come down in the fourth quarter of 2010. As at end-2010, the NPL ratio for household loans was 2.3%. The ratio of household loan repayment-to-disbursement increased marginally to 87.8%.</p><p>The highly-competitive environment and the increased indebtedness of households have called for pre-emptive measures to preserve the resilience of the household sector going forward. Although personal bankruptcies and relapse rate among borrowers under AKPK's Debt Management Programme have been manageable, they have been on the increase since 2007.</p><p>Several initiatives have been implemented during the year to ensure the continued resilience of the household sector, including a programme to educate younger and first-time borrowers on responsible borrowing, tighter standards for credit cards and enhanced requirements on the conduct of business by financial institutions in retail financing.</p><p>For Bank Negara statements click here</p>\r\n",

      "<p>PETALING JAYA: Five accounting firms were the first to run into trouble with the Audit Oversight Board (AOB) because they had accepted appointments last year as auditors of public interest entities (PIEs) without first registering with the board.</p><p>Three listed companies  <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=BTECH\" target=\"_blank\">Brite-Tech Bhd</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=BTECH\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a>, <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=CNASIA\" target=\"_blank\">CN Asia Corp Bhd</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=CNASIA\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a> and <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=MINTYE\" target=\"_blank\">Mintye Industries Bhd</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=MINTYE\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a>  were among those that had engaged these firms when it was illegal for them to act as auditors of PIEs.</p><p>After detecting these cases in its monitoring of the AGMs of PIEs, the AOB sent show-cause letters to the five firms, asking them to explain why they had failed to register with the board before agreeing to become auditors of the PIEs. However, because the regulatory framework for auditors was just introduced last April, the firms have been spared stiff penalties and are allowed to audit the financial statements of PIEs.</p><p>AOB executive chairman Nik Mohd Hasyudeen Yusoff said that the idea behind setting up the board was to ensure robust oversight of auditors. As such, it viewed any breach of law seriously.</p><p>He added that the AOB had dealt swiftly with the five firms and had sent “a very strong signal” that it would not tolerate such incidents in the future.</p><p>“Having considered the firms' explanations and considering that this is the first year that the new law is implemented, we issued warning letters to them. We also require them to do certain reporting to us on a periodical basis to make sure that they are in compliance with the law. They are now registered. These are issues that we faced at the early stage of implementing this new law,” he told StarBiz.</p><p>The Securities Commission Act 1993 was amended last year to provide for the establishment of the AOB and for related matters. Among other things, the new rules require that an auditor of a PIE be registered with the AOB. PIEs include listed companies, banking and financial institutions (including Islamic banks and development financial institutions), insurance companies and takaful operators, and holders of Capital Market Services Licences (such as securities and futures trading firms, and fund management companies).</p><p>The amendments came into effect on April Fools' Day last year, which was also the day the AOB commenced operations. This meant that auditors that were due to be reappointed in AGMs scheduled to be held in the first few days of April had to quickly register with the board.</p><p>Given that many of their audit clients are PIEs, the larger firms were naturally among the earliest to be registered. For example, Ernst &amp; Young (EY) and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) were registered on April 1 itself, while KPMG got into the AOB register of auditors on April 9.</p><p>Mohd Hasyudeen explained that the board could register EY and PwC on its first day because a lot of groundwork had been done earlier to ensure that the firms knew the criteria for registration and could thus submit applications with the necessary information and documentation.</p><p>He said: “We approved the applications (on April 1) because we were satisfied that they met the criteria. We were able to make these decisions because we had made all the preparations.”</p><p>Prior to April, the Securities Commission had made available the registration handbooks and forms, and had fielded enquiries about the registration process.</p><p>Another factor that figured in the AOB's speedy approval of registration applications was the need to avoid disruptions in the PIEs' appointment of auditors.</p><p>“AGMs had already been scheduled and we did not want to see companies having to postpone the meetings and incurring costs just because the auditors could not accept appointments after failing to register in time.</p><p>“We pre-empted all these issues to make sure there was a smooth transition and implementation. We are in the confidence-building business. News that companies have failed to appoint auditors may not be positive. So we cautiously manage that process,” Mohd Hasyudeen said.</p><p>For the board, there is an additional layer of assurance in the fact that a criterion for AOB registration is that the auditors must already be approved by the Finance Ministry under Section 8 of the Companies Act 1965. Under the Companies Act, the Finance Minister gives such an approval to a company auditor when satisfied that the applicant is “of good character and competent to perform the duties of an auditor under this Act”.</p><p>Mohd Hasyudeen pointed out that the registration process is not the only time that the auditors are subject to the AOB's scrutiny. “If the auditors are registered and subsequently we find that they have not been truthful to us  say, they have submitted misleading information or have omitted important information  we will act against them. That's why we conduct inspections of auditors,” he added.</p><p>The AOB declined to provide details of the five accounting firms that have been given warnings. However, by comparing announcements on the Bursa Malaysia website with the board's register of auditors, StarBiz has found that three firms had been appointed auditors of listed companies before they had been registered with the AOB (see table on B1). Another three were appointed on the same day their applications for registration were approved.</p><p>On the status of the latter three, Mohd Hasyudeen said: “We registered them because we were satisfied that they had fulfilled our requirements. We take it that they were each registered on that particular date.”</p>\r\n",

Information is extracted, among others, from the Companies Commission of Malaysia and Bank Negara.</p><p>“By using the default probability model we can gauge the likelihood of an SME’s ability to repay over the next 12 months. This is premised on their payment behaviour over the past 12 months.</p><p>“If they have been successful in making payments over the last 12 months then the probability of defaulting in payment is low and vice versa,” he tells StarBizWeek.</p><p>Another scale used in credit rating, he adds, is the percentile ranking which shows SMEs ability to pay relative to the entire SME universe. The higher the percentile ranking, the higher the SME’s ability to pay up the loan, he notes.</p><p>Having credible information and reliable data cuts down the bank’s processing time for applications of loans by average between 20% and 30%.</p><p>Having tied-up with US-based Dun &amp; Bradstreet, he says, has enable the Bureau to localise and tap the expertise of its partner in credit ratings as the former has years of experience in the specialisation of solutions for credit bureaus worldwide. Dun &amp; Bradstreet’s methodology has been used by credit bureau’s globally for more than two decades.</p><p>The Bureau at present has about 26,500 SME members fromover 500,000 SMEs in the country, and 38 member financial institutions. These include commercial banks, development financial institutions and Islamic banks.</p><p>SMEs wanting to be members must sign a contract with the Bureau. Based on the principal of reciprocity, they can only then access information if they provide authentic data to the Bureau.</p><p>Lim stresses that the Bureau does not provide any recommendations to extend or deny credit to SMEs, but rather aid them in building a track record and financial standing for facilitating funding.</p><p>He points out that the Bureau has spent millions to ensure that the data retrieved and stored is safe and not open to tampering or abuse. He says it will make significant investment over time in its bid to become a one-stop centre for credit information for financial institutions and SMEs.</p><p>To beef up its credit ratings and to curb fraud, the Bureau will launch on Feb 1 Malaysia’s first Credit Monitoring Services (CMS) for SMEs. Early this month, it introduced a similar service for financial institutions. The CMS system monitors key changes in banking and business information, trade credit information as well as credit ratings of SMEs.</p><p>These changes in data are then sent out as email alerts to SMEs who subscribe to the service.</p><p>By alerting them, Lim says the CMS can prevent fraud and identity theft as well as any discrepancies or changes to their credit information.</p><p>Identity theft occurs, for example, if an SME’s identity is used illegally to apply for credit, and changes to credit information occur when there is new loan applications, enquiries by financial institutions, and other credit guarantors and utilities related updates.</p><p>Apart from receiving email alerts upon changes of their information in the Bureau’s database, SMEs may also purchase the self enquiry report separately if more detailed information is required, he noted. A nominal fee of RM50 per year will be imposed on SMEs that wish to subscribe for the service.</p><p>“An effective CMS system will ensure that SMEs growth will not be hindered or affected by identity theft and fraud. It also ensures their business registry and credit information are kept updated and accurate to ensure their applications for financing will not be jeopardised by inaccurate or out dated credit information,” Lim says, adding that CMS will promote good credit culture among SMEs, which will ultimately lead to more credit facilities in less time.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>PETALING JAYA: The capital market is set to get its version of the banking sector’s Financial Mediation Bureau (FMB). Once in place, this will be another avenue for retail investors to seek an end to disputes with intermediaries such as stockbrokers, unit trust companies, financial planners and investment advisers.</p><p>In coming up with this so-called alternative dispute resolution framework, the Securities Commission (SC) is consulting industry players as well as public interest groups such as the Minority Shareholder Watchdog Group and the Federation of Malaysian Consumer Associations.</p><p>The regulator is also drawing upon the experiences of Australia, Singapore, Britain and the FMB.</p><p>The need for such an initiative in Malaysia was highlighted in the Capital Market Masterplan, which was issued in February 2001.</p><p>The report said the efforts toward more effective enforcement should include “ensuring appropriate mechanisms for investor redress and dispute resolution that can minimise enforcement costs and delays”. The recent worldwide recession has injected some urgency into the matter.</p><p>“The global crisis demonstrates that one aspect for achieving greater investor protection and confidence is to provide a mechanism whereby investors’ grievances can be settled in an efficient, speedy and amicable manner,” said an SC spokesman.</p><p>“Our study shows that there exists a gap in redress mechanism available to investors in the capital market.”</p><p>The spokesman added that investors would normally try to first resolve their disputes directly with the intermediaries. The drawback here was that the investors might perceive the intermediaries as biased.</p><p>The investors cannot turn to the Malaysian Consumer Claims Tribunal because it excludes disputes relating to securities and futures transactions. Neither can they go to the FMB, which focuses on disputes relating to banking, insurance and payment transactions.</p><p>“The only other avenue that is an independent and transparent redress mechanism is through legal proceedings in the courts or arbitration process, which can be lengthy and costly for both the investor and intermediary,” said the SC spokesman.</p><p>The regulator said details for the alternative dispute resolution framework were being worked out with various industry groups in the capital market. Under the Capital Market and Services Act 2007, regulations may be issued to deal with dispute resolution between persons involved in capital market transactions.</p><p>“Once the review is completed, appropriate regulations and guidelines would be released by the SC,” said the spokesman.</p><p>The FMB describes itself as an independent body set up to help settle disputes between consumers and the financial services providers, who are its members.</p><p>These members include commercial banks, investment banks, Islamic banks, insurance companies, takaful operators, development financial institutions, and payment system operators and payment instrument issuers.</p><p>In its website, the bureau explains that mediation is a process by which the mediator helps both the complainant and the financial service provider to resolve the complaint by first investigating the complaint.</p><p>If the parties involved in the complaint cannot reach an amicable settlement, the mediator will make a decision based on the investigation, industry practices and the relevant applicable law. The FMB’s award or decision is binding on the institutions but not the complainant.</p><p>In Singapore, Britain and Australia, the organisations that mediate complaints relating to capital market transactions come under boards of directors that represent both industry and consumer interests.</p>\r\n",

Part of the institutional building was the establishment of regulatory institutions such as the Securities Commission, the Cooperative Commission and the Labuan Offshore Financial Services Authority.</p><p>Specialised development financial institutions were also set up to provide financial services to sectors that were not serviced by existing financial institutions.</p><p>The 1960s saw the rapid expansion of domestic financial institutions while the 1970s witnessed the emergence of merchant banking, the capital market and non-bank financial institutions.</p><p>In the last two decades, a comprehensive Islamic financial system has also evolved in Malaysia including institutions, markets and supporting legal, regulatory and supervisory framework.</p><p>Since 1988, the central bank also assumed responsibility for the insurance industry and the development of financial institutions in 2002.</p><p>Financial market development has also been central to building a robust financial system. Bank Negara’s efforts in this direction included establishing institutions and the infrastructure to improve the efficiency of money, capital and foreign exchange markets.</p><p>The 1990s saw the establishment of the Securities Commission responsible for the securities industry, financial futures and options markets, unit trust and property trust schemes, as well as takeovers and mergers.</p><p>In addition to the ratings agencies, the Credit Guarantee Corp was established to provide support for small businesses while the national mortgage corporation, Cagamas Bhd, was formed to ensure a steady flow of funds to the housing industry and to develop a secondary mortgage market.</p><p>In terms of financial infrastructure, the central bank set up the centrally coordinated credit information system at national level which allows for better-informed credit decisions by financial institutions.</p><p>Also part of the financial infrastructure is payments, which has evolved from mainly paper-based to one that includes a range of new electronic forms of payment.</p><p>To ensure stability in the financial system, the central bank’s prudential regulatory and supervisory framework during the past 50 years has also undergone significant evolution.</p><p>The prudential framework, which at the start comprised simple rules addressing capital, gearing, liquidity and portfolio restrictions, has evolved into a more differentiated and principle-based regulations reflecting the levels of risks taken by an institution.</p><p>Flexible framework</p><p>As a result, significantly greater flexibility is now accorded to institutions that demonstrate sound governance practices and robust risk management capabilities.</p><p>This flexibility has been accompanied by fundamental changes in supervision which has shifted from a predominantly compliance-based approach, to one that focuses on the assessment of risk-taking activities of an institution and the control functions to manage the risks.</p><p>The supervisory tools have also grown to include forward-looking assessments of the risks to financial stability, supported by more dynamic stress testing and enhanced surveillance systems.</p><p>The Financial Sector Masterplan, released in 2001, is a blueprint for comprehensive financial sector reforms and provides the framework and strategies for the modernisation of the financial system.</p><p>The financial safety net was also strengthened with the introduction of a comprehensive deposit insurance system and organisations to help consumers manage their debts and resolve disputes with financial institutions.</p><p>During the Asian financial crisis, when regional currencies plummeted to historical lows, Malaysia implemented selective capital controls and de-internationalised the ringgit. This was instrumental in restoring stability in the market and acted very much like a circuit breaker.</p><p>Offshore trading of the ringgit, the major source for financing the speculative attacks, was effectively eliminated. Within a year, all the controls imposed were removed.</p><p>An extensive set of measures was also implemented during the Asian financial crisis, including a comprehensive restructuring programme for the financial and corporate sectors.</p><p>While still at the early stage of the crisis, an asset management company was formed to acquire and manage the non-performing loans of banking institutions.</p><p>A special-purpose vehicle to recapitalise banking institutions and a Corporate Debt Restructuring Committee were also established to provide avenues for voluntary debt restructuring of businesses.</p><p>Within six months of the implementation of these measures, the problems in the financial sector were addressed and lending activities resumed.</p><p>Once stability was restored, the central bank embarked on a comprehensive restructuring and reform of the financial sector.</p><p>These included the consolidation of domestic financial institutions, strengthening corporate governance, risk management and the institutional capacity of domestic financial institutions, as well as the deepening of the bond market.</p><p>These efforts have put Malaysia’s financial system in a much stronger position to weather the current global financial crisis.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>NATIONAL deposit insurer, Perbadanan Insurans Deposit Malaysia (PIDM), expects to increase awareness of deposit insurance in Malaysia to 40% by 2011.</p><p>The awareness of deposit insurance had increased to 27% last year compared with 13% and 15% in 2006 and 2007 respectively, based on an annual nationwide survey commisioned by PIDM.</p><p>According to its communications and public affairs general manager S. Loganathan, communications and public awareness is one of PIDM’s key functions in ensuring the effectiveness of the deposit insurance system.</p><p>“Awareness of deposit protection is important because it promotes public confidence in the financial system. With greater awareness, the public will be assured that their deposits are protected.</p><p>“A well-informed public is less susceptible to rumours relating to the viability of a bank,” Loganathan explains.</p><p>In 2008, the deposit insurer spent over RM6mil for its public awareness programmes.</p><p>These programmes include public talks, roadshows, seminars, conferences as well as advertising campaigns via various media channels such as television, radio and print.</p><p>What is unique about PIDM’s awareness programmes is that its advertisements and communications channels are available in various languages.</p><p>Its website, www.pidm.gov.my, is accessible in Bahasa Malaysia, English, Chinese and Tamil while the public information brochures, entitled Your Deposits Are Protected, are available in the four languages as well as two others – Kadazandusun and Iban – for the benefit of depositors in Sabah and Sarawak.</p><p>Deposit insurance was introduced in the United States in 1934 during the Great Depression.</p><p>A wave of bank failures in 1930 triggered widespread attempts to convert deposits into cash, according to Loganathan.</p><p>“As more banks were unable to meet withdrawals and closed, depositors became more sensitive to rumours. Confidence in the banking system started to erode and incidences of bank ‘runs’ became more common,” he says. (A run on bank refers to the state of panic which results when a large number of customers fear a bank could be insolvent and rush to withdraw their deposits.)</p><p>The enactment of the Banking Act 1933 by the US government and the setting up of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) restored public confidence and significantly reduced the incidences of bank runs.</p><p>In Malaysia, the 2001 Financial Sector Masterplan recommended the setting up of a deposit insurance system to further strengthen the depositor protection framework.</p><p>PIDM, a statutory body established under the Akta Perbadanan Insurans Deposit Malaysia 2005, was formed in August 2005 and the deposit insurance system was launched on Sept 1, 2005.</p><p>Under the system, PIDM provides explicit coverage of RM60,000 per depositor per member bank.</p><p>“In the unlikely event of a bank failure, depositors will be promptly reimbursed on their insured deposits,” Loganathan says.</p><p>However, with the implementation of the Government Deposit Guarantee (GDG) in October 2008, all ringgit and foreign currency deposits are fully protected until Dec 31, 2010.</p><p>The GDG applies to deposits held in commercial, Islamic, investment and international Islamic banks, as well as in deposit-taking development financial institutions regulated by Bank Negara.</p><p>According to Loganathan, the current plans are to revert to the explicit and limited coverage deposit insurance system after the aforesaid date.</p><p>On whether the limit or scope of coverage will be increased going forward, Loganathan says PIDM will continue to monitor developments in the banking system and will make recommendations to the Government.</p><p>In relation to this, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Bank Negara and the Monetary Authority of Singapore announced on July 22 the setting up of a tripartite working group to map out a coordinated strategy for the scheduled exit of the full deposit guarantee by the end of 2010.</p><p>Besides assessing and collecting premiums from member banks, PIDM’s functions also include managing deposit insurance funds as well as providing incentives to promote sound risk management in Malaysia’s financial system.</p><p>For the financial year ended Dec 31, 2008 (FY08), PIDM recorded revenue of RM98.5mil, comprising RM90mil premiums and RM8.5mil investment income. Its operating expenditure totalled RM34.5mil.</p><p>PIDM’s conventional and Islamic deposit insurance funds stood at RM243mil and RM32.3mil respectively at the end of 2008.</p><p>For FY09, PIDM targets a premium revenue of RM147mil, driven by the full implementation of the differential premium system (DPS) for its member banks.</p><p>According to Loganathan, the DPS differentiates member banks according to their risk profile and classifies them into four premium categories.</p><p>The tiered premium rates range from 0.03% of the total insured deposits for Category One financial institutions to a maximum of 0.24% for those in Category Four.</p><p>“This is part of our efforts to promote better risk management,” he said.</p><p>Until 2007, PIDM have assessed premiums against its member institutions on a flat rate of 0.06% of total insured deposits.</p><p>Moving forward, Loganathan says PIDM will continue to focus on intensifying its risk assessment besides developing its capacity to handle intervention and failure resolutions as well as developing its human capital.</p>\r\n",

Essentially, PIDM is responsible for the entire amount of deposits.</p><p>PIDM will soon charge a guaranteed fee to all its member commercial and Islamic banks for deposits above RM60,000 per depositor and for products not insured, for example, foreign currency deposits.</p><p>Apart from member banks, PIDM also charges the guaranteed fee on investment banks, international Islamic banks and deposit taking development financial institutions (DFIs).</p><p>“We will take that fee and pay it to the Government which is giving us the guarantee,’’ said Sabourin.</p><p>The task of building confidence is a serious matter at PIDM. It involves setting up public awareness campaigns, training at branches, meeting bank officers together with officers from Bank Negara, the Financial Mediation Bureau (FMB), credit counselling and management agency (AKPK) and meeting the public on how the entire system works.</p><p>Its brochures, annual reports and website come in several languages. For the call centre, toll free lines are available in four languages and main dialects. “This is what the Government should do ... (explain to people) as slowly as they require and in the language they understand.’’</p><p>“I feel confident (that we can deal with any crisis), with all the infrastructure in place and the vision in this country,’’ said Sabourin.</p><p>Together with deposit insurance, the system is backed by the AKPK, FMB, Islamic banking system, government stimulus package, guarantees and lately, the Corporate Debt Restructuring Committee (CDRC).</p><p>“It seems to me they have put in the whole package,’’ he said. “Everyone is working together. Banks are also working with their clients on any potential financial problems. “They invite customers to talk to them. In some other countries, people don’t even know who to call if they are losing their homes,’’ he said.</p><p>Globally, the response to the crisis has been two-pronged. Governments in Europe, Britain and the United States have been putting in a lot of liquidity and capital. The other approach, adopted by countries like Malaysia, is to put in place mechanisms to promote stability and public confidence.</p><p>For latest Bursa Malaysia indices, charts and other information click here  </p><p>For latest Bursa Malaysia indices, charts and other information click here</p>\r\n",

      "<p>THANKS to Bank Negara’s intervention, some 35% of the more than 230 small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) that complained of difficulty gaining access to financing have good reason to cheer.</p><p>Corporate communications department director Abu Hassan Alshari Yahaya tells StarBizWeek that of the complaints received from these SMEs between October and January this year, 81% have been resolved.</p><p>For the resolved cases, 44% were in favour of the SMEs and involved restructuring and rescheduling of loans, and also approval of loans that were initially rejected.</p><p>The central bank will continue to monitor communications among banks and SMEs, he says.</p><p>He says Bank Negara receives about 700 complaints and enquiries from SMEs and the public every day on issues ranging from restructuring and rescheduling of credit line, delay in loan approvals, changes in credit terms, bank charges, credit card issues, funds for SMEs and credit report.</p><p>“We encourage banks to look closer into  customers’ complaints. We give the banks a timeline (about two weeks) to respond to Bank Negara enquiries on what they are going to do about the complaints.</p><p>“While we are assisting SMEs, we also encourage SMEs to approach their banks early,” he says.</p><p>He adds that in processing SMEs loan applications, most banks find that SMEs have no track record and provide insufficient information.</p><p>Meanwhile, he suggests the smaller SMEs consider special funds that cater for them, which come with lower interest rates.</p><p>For example, the Fund for SMEs 20 is based on revolving loan charges between 4% and 6% interest rate per year. The fund still has RM280mil available.</p><p>The new Entrepreneurs Fund 2, which also offers 4% to 6% interest rate per year, has RM270mil available for new SMEs without an established record.</p><p>These loans are available at commercial banks.</p><p>United Overseas Bank (M) Bhd head of business banking division James Seow concurs that the most common problem faced by banks is insufficient information provided in the application.</p><p>“To avoid any inconvenience, we advise all applicants to work closely with their respective bank’s relationship managers. Financial health is integral to the success of SMEs’ loan application,” he tells StarBizWeek in an e-mail interview.</p><p>The general loan application requirements include having a business that has been operating for at least three years with an annual turnover of RM20mil and less, he says.</p><p>Seow says SMEs are the bank’s main target segment.</p><p>“We are now more aggressive in assisting our SME customers by customising loan packages to suit their business financial needs. The government guarantee will definitely help the bank mitigate some of the business risk,” he says.</p><p>According to Seow, the base lending rate remains the same for SME and corporate loans. The difference in interest rates is due to the loan amount, customer’s risk profile and the rates recommended by Bank Negara.</p><p>SMI Association of Malaysia president Chua Tiam Wee says the reversal in banks’ decision on financing facilities for SMEs is encouraging news to the industry in the current economic slowdown.</p><p>He says the association, which has been bringing SMEs’ financing issue to Bank Negara, has in the past few months held several dialogues with the central bank on the challenges faced by SMEs.</p><p>Chua urges SMEs to use the Bank Negara-initiated portal www.smeinfo.com.my as an avenue to air their problems and concerns.</p><p>The portal is a one-stop Web-based SME resources centre that contains the profiles and contact details of SME business advisers in the various government agencies, commercial banks and development financial institutions.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Association of Banks in Malaysia executive director Chuah Mei Lin assures the SMEs that bankers are not just fair weather friends, as banks fully appreciate the collaboration and partnership with customers in times when businesses contract.</p><p>“SMEs must themselves be active participants in raising capital and it is important that they demonstrate adaptability to change.</p><p>“Banks are also proactively managing their portfolio of loans to help customers during this downturn,” she says.</p><p>She says applicants must not only build a track record of prudent financial management but also keep debt commitments at a level proportionate to cashflow generative capability.</p>\r\n",

Banks are also limiting the sectors to which they can lend.</p><p>Bank Negara’s latest cut in the overnight policy rate and the statutory reserve requirement to reduce the cost of funds appears to have fallen on the deaf ears of many banks.</p><p>SMI Association of Malaysia Fund Raising Bureau chairman Steven Lim said in a recent dialogue with various business associations, Bank Negara governor Tan Sri Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz had confirmed that banks were in a strong position to lend.</p><p>“Contrary to this, Malaysian banks are not heeding the central bank’s advice and are over-cautious when lending is concerned.</p><p>“Even the process for deserving applicants can be very tedious. The processing and turnaround time for the loans to be approved can take three to four months in some cases and this can defeat the customers’ business objectives,” he said in an e-mail reply to StarBiz.</p><p>To make things worse, Lim added, even deserving applicants in some cases were unsuccessful in their applications and blamed banks for over-reacting to the global economic slowdown and the financial crisis.</p><p>About 99% of business establishments in the country consisted of SMEs, which contributed 32% to the gross domestic product (GDP), provided 56% employment and accounted for 19% of total exports last year.</p><p>Banking and development financial institutions approved RM63.2bil in funding for over 132,000 SME accounts in 2007, exceeding the target of RM51bil to 110,000 accounts projected for last year.</p><p>It is learnt that banks had started reviewing existing loan files to determine whether borrowers (including companies and businessmen) were capable of repayment in the near future, failing which, loans would either be reduced or called back.</p><p>A company involved in the iron and steel industry recently had its overdraft facility slashed to half the original approved sum of RM200mil on the grounds that the price of raw materials had plummeted. There are others facing a similar predicament.</p><p>According to Lim, banks had also imposed “barred sectors” on certain industries, such as development and construction, used-car dealers and transportation where they were the least to be considered for any loan application.</p><p>According to a CEO of a manufacturing company, banks were shoring up their recovery departments in anticipation of “problem” loans expected to emerge next year.</p><p>.</p><p>Standard Chartered Bank (M) Bhd (StanChart) managing director and CEO Julian Wynter, on the other hand, said the bank had not reduced its lending or changed the way it undertook credit assessment – both to individuals and businesses.</p><p>“We do not expect a dramatic shift in lending practices. We should expect tightening of underwriting standards in the market but, for StanChart, our standards are already robust and we continue to apply them.</p><p>“At the same time there may be a focus on collateral to ensure optimisation of capital so that lending can remain in place and/or lower pricing. These factors will allow a bank to ensure that its asset quality remains strong,’’ he added.</p><p>StanChart’s lending to medium enterprises had expanded 40% over the last 12 months from October 2007.</p><p>Wynter said the bank’s trade and working capital disbursement pipeline as at Oct 31 was 99% higher than (the disbursement pipeline) as at Jan 31.</p><p>According to him, the bank aimed to double its lending to SMEs to RM6bil in 2011.

Banking institutions were the main provider of funds to SMEs, with a total approval of RM39.6bil to more than 84,000 SME accounts.</p><p>Reflecting an increasing trend, loans to SMEs from banking institutions had risen from 31.1% of total business loans in 2000 to 44.5% in 2006. Total SME outstanding loans from banking institutions breached the RM100bil level in 2006.</p><p>The success of many smaller companies including SMEs, among others, depends on the efficient management of working capital (WC).</p><p>WC is a measure of both a company's efficiency and its short-term financial health. Positive working capital means that the company is able to pay off its short-term liabilities. Negative working capital, on the other hand, means that a company is currently unable to meet its short-term liabilities with its current assets.</p><p>If a company's current assets do not exceed its current liabilities, then it may run into trouble paying back creditors in the short term. The worst-case scenario is bankruptcy.</p><p>HSBC Bank Malaysia Bhd director for global payments and cash management Jason Tan said with the global inflation and credit market tightening, companies including SMEs were finding it difficult to obtain loans or manage WC efficiently.</p><p>Although Malaysia was relatively quite insulated compared with other countries, this trend was slowly creeping into the country, he added.</p><p>“This has led SMEs to be squeezed on both ends – the difficulty in getting loans to finance their collections on one end, and to make their payments on the other end. They should work closely with their banking partners on how to manage their collections and payments efficiently,” he added.</p><p>According to Tan, some banks now provide earlier financing to SMEs who are waiting for their collections from buyers. This sort of financing allows faster collection for SMEs although the financing would be at a discounted amount to the original sum that buyers owed them.</p><p>Apart from the above trend, banks are also playing a more proactive role in providing advisory services to this sector. This include short messaging service (SMS) and e-mailing to buyers on behalf of SMEs for payments and collections.</p><p>HSBC Bank has recommended five tips for SMEs to shop and ensure efficient WC. Firstly, they should start to take advantage of early payment incentives offered by its business partners.</p><p>Secondly, they should stretch out their payable period and maximise it if possible. Thirdly, they should organise and have systematic billing schedule to ensure faster collection, hence the ability to grow their business faster.</p><p>Fourthly, they need to have better control of their inventory to help improve cash flow and lastly they need to check their pricing and hike it if possible in accordance with the global economic indicators.</p><p>For more details contact: 1800 88 3898</p>\r\n",

      "<b>By DANNY YAP</b><p>EFFECTIVE Feb 1, banking institutions will be required to provide “basic banking services” to Malaysians at minimal costs, Bank Negara governor Tan Sri Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz said. </p><p> She said that guidelines had been issued to banking institutions to govern the imposition of fees and charges. </p><p> “The guidelines specify the minimum threshold of services and monthly transactions that are to be offered without charge,” Zeti told reporters after the launch of the Financial Mediation Bureau (FMB) in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.  </p><p> Details of the services offered under the guidelines were also announced yesterday. </p><p> Zeti said that over and above these financial services, as products and services become more complex, financial institutions needed to provide appropriate pricing that not only reflected the costs but also adequately reflected cost savings that arise from the investments made. </p><p> “In an increasingly competitive environment, efforts need to be continuously aimed at enhancing efficiency and cost-effectiveness to bring benefits not only to consumers and businesses but also to the overall economy,” she stressed. </p><p> Zeti said one of the crucial elements of the safety net for consumers was deposit insurance. </p><p></p><table align=\"left\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"7\" width=\"239\"> <tr><td> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/52521591-A0F3-49FE-A554-D8D248CC51CD\"/> </td></tr> <tr><td><div class=\"migration_caption\">Tan Sri Zeti Akhtar Aziz (left) and Tan Sri Haidar Mohamed Noor at the launch of FMB on Thursday.</div></td></tr></table><p> She said work in this area was at an advanced stage and the scheme would be operational soon. </p><p> “The deposit insurance system is expected to further strengthen incentives for financial institutions to adopt sound financial and business practices,” Zeti said, adding that it would also enhance public confidence in the financial system by providing explicit protection on deposits. </p><p> She said Bank Negara would continue to focus on the development of necessary infrastructure to safeguard consumer interest and ensure that consumers were given greater access to information on financial products and services for them to make well-informed choices. </p><p> On the setting up of the FMB, she said that with the blurring of the traditional boundaries between financial products and services provided by banks, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries, an integrated bureau was necessary to resolve a broad range of consumer issues raised in relation to these financial institutions under the supervision of the central bank. </p><p> “There are also clear synergies to be achieved from leveraging on the resources available to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the dispute resolution process, as consumers will be provided with a convenient and efficient one-stop formal redress as an alternative to litigation, which is time consuming and resource draining,” the Governor said. </p><p> Zeti said the creation of an integrated agency was in line with international trends towards such resolution centres, and the framework and model for the FMB had been benchmarked against best practices worldwide, notably in countries such as Britain, Canada and Australia. </p><p> The scope of FMB has been expanded to cover, for the first time, Islamic banks, <i>takaful </i>operators, development financial institutions, as well as select payment systems operators and non-bank issuers of credit and charge cards. </p><p> “Apart from the expanded coverage, FMB plans to improve its nationwide accessibility by progressively establishing five regional offices,” she said. </p><p> FMB chairman Tan Sri Haidar Mohamed Noor pointed out that the bureau would be governed by a board of directors comprising nine members, of whom five are independent directors, and the balance from the banking and insurance industries. </p><p> “The FMB, being an alternative dispute resolution centre, provides consumers with an option to the courts with their complaints, disputes or claims,” he said. </p><p> For banking and other financial institutions, he said FMB would handle claims not exceeding RM100,000 for both consumer and corporate banking related businesses. </p><p> For fraud cases involving credit cards, charge cards and cheques, FMB would handle cases not over RM25,000. </p><p> For Islamic insurance (<i>takaful</i>) cases, the value should not be more than RM200,000 (motor and fire insurance) and for third-party damage, not more than RM5,000. </p><p> “The decision of the FMB is binding on the financial service provider but not the consumer,” Haidar said, adding that dissatisfied complainant may proceed with legal proceedings. </p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.bnm.gov.my/index.php?ch=8&amp;pg=14&amp;ac=964\" target=\"on_top\">Banking Institutions to Offer Basic Savings Account and Basic Current Account -

      "<b></b><p><b>This is the second in a three-part question-and-answer series provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers for <i>The Star</i> readers on various aspects of Budget 2005. The final part will appear in <i>StarBiz</i> tomorrow.</b> </p><p><b><i>Q: The Finance Minister in presenting his 2005 Budget speech spoke on establishing a fund for tax refund. Can you explain what is the effect?  </i></b></p><p> A: When the Government introduced assessment on the current-year basis as well as the self assessment system (SAS), there are companies which have made excess payments on their tax. These companies are entitled to claim refund from the Government. </p><p> Up to now, there has been no change in the procedure of paying refund as tax collected under the Income Tax Act goes into the consolidated fund and cannot be used to make refund.  </p><p> The Inland Revenue Board (IRB) has to obtain the necessary fund from the Treasury. If the Treasury does not provide the fund, the IRB would not be in a position to make the refund.  </p><p> With the establishment of a fund for tax refund, tax collected can be allocated into the fund as determined by the Finance Minister directly and the IRB would be allowed to utilise the monies from the fund to make refund. </p><p> This will certainly improve the Government's delivery system as refunds will be made in a shorter period. </p><p> <u> <b><i></i></b></u>Q: The Finance Minister has announced that there will be changes in claiming the Industrial Building Allowance for purchase of a used industrial building. My company intends to buy a used building to expand its activities. Can you advise me how the proposed change will impact my claim on the industrial building? </p><p> A: The proposed change is to overcome the difficulty faced by the taxpayer, i.e. the acquirer of the used industrial building, in computing the annual allowance, i.e. Industrial Building Allowance (IBA).  </p><p> Based on the current law, the acquirer of a used building can claim IBA based on the tax residual value of the construction cost (i.e. construction cost less allowances claimed to date). The acquirer would have to obtain the information on the construction cost from the vendor. The acquirer may have difficulty in obtaining the information.  </p><p> The proposed change in law is to simplify the claim for IBA as the basis of the computation of IBA will be calculated on the current purchase price notwithstanding that the disposer will be subject to the balancing allowance or balancing charge. In your case, say if the purchase price of the building is RM1mil, the company will be entitled to claim initial allowance of 10% and annual allowance of 3% in the year of acquisition.  </p><p> <b><i>Q: The recent budget proposed that interest-in-suspense be deemed as specific provision for bad debts and allowed a full deduction in the computation of income tax. Does this apply to stockbroking companies? </i></b></p><p> A: Section 34 of the Income Tax Act 1967 (ITA) governs the tax treatment of provision for doubtful debts. The new Section 34 subsection 3B of the Income Tax Act 1967 defines a “bank” as a bank or finance company or a banking and finance company licensed or deemed to be licensed under the Banking and Financial Institutions Act 1989 or Islamic Banking Act 1983, or an institution prescribed under the Development Financial Institutions Act 2002. Stockbroking companies appear not to be covered by the above provision. </p><p> <i> <b>Q: The Government has increased the duty for cigarettes again this year.  As a smoker, can I know how much will the price of cigarettes be increased? </b></i></p><p> A: The 2005 Budget has announced a change in the duty structure for cigarettes. The changes in the rate of import duty and excise duty are as follows: </p><p> <b>Old import duty:</b> RM200/kg. <b>New import duty:</b> RM0.20/stick. </p><p> <b>Old excise duty:</b> RM58/kg. <b>New excise duty:</b> RM81/1,000 sticks.  </p><p> The Minister of Finance in his budget speech mentioned an increase in excise duty rates to promote a healthy lifestyle. The increase in excise duty to be around 40%, for imported as well as locally manufactured cigarettes. The increase in the excise duty would also increase the amount of sales tax paid.  </p><p> The impact of the increase on the consumer would ultimately depend on how much of the increase will be passed down by the tobacco manufacturers and importers. The higher costs will increase the incidence of cigarette smuggling and would have to be addressed by the authorities.  </p><p> <b><i>Q: The abolishment of the import duty on semi-finished components for the wood-based industry would benefit the construction industry. Would this benefit be passed on to the property buyers? </i></b></p><p> A: Although construction costs are expected to be reduced in the case where imported components are used, the benefit may be minimal. It would be up to the developers to determine how much of the reduction, if any to be passed to the property buyers.  </p><p> <b><i>Q:</i></b><u> <b></b></u>It was anticipated that Budget 2005 will be a “caring” budget.  How will Budget 2005 benefit the man in the street? </p><p> A: The proposals that will benefit individual taxpayers at large include the following, which will come into effect beginning in Year of Assessment 2005: </p><p> ·The relief for the purchase of books to increase from RM500 to RM700 to promote the reading habit; </p><p> ·The limit on relief for EPF contributions and/for insurance premium to be increased from RM5,000 to RM6,000; and </p><p> ·The rebate for the purchase of a personal computer to increase from RM400 to RM500 to promote the penetration of ICT into the Malaysian society.  </p><p><b>Part One:</b><a href=\"http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2004/9/12/business/8881316&amp;sec=business\">GST to replace sales and services tax</a> </p><p></p><p></p><p>\r\n",

      "<b></b><p><b>Amid the interest in GLC revamps, it is easy to forget those that are not listed. Undercapitalised and burdened by bad loans, Bank Industri &amp; Teknologi Malaysia needs rejuvenation. The process has already begun, says Othman Mohd Rijal.</b> </p><p>AMID the expectation that a successful revamp of government-linked companies(GLCs) will boost the stock market,it is easy to forget that not all ofthese companies are listed. For thatmatter, some of them will never getto Bursa Malaysia simply becausemaking profits is not their raisond'être. </p><p>However, even for these companies, there is no escaping the mounting pressure to perform better. Bank Industri &amp; Teknologi Malaysia Bhd knows all about this. It celebrated its 25th anniversary last month, but this year is meaningful not just because of the silverjubilee. </p><p>Undercapitalised and burdened by the high-risk lending it is called upon to provide, Bank Industri is reshaping itself. The restructuring is expected to be completed by the year-end. </p><p>The idea is to become stronger in dealing with changes in the financial services business and in the strategic sectors that the bank focuses on. </p><p>Over the years, the bank's basic role has been the same – to give medium to long-term financing to strategic capital-intensive industries. What have changed significantly are the nature of these industries and the ability of the domestic capital market to finance their businesses. </p><p>Bank Industri chairman Tan Sri Othman Mohd Rijal says the bank must reposition itself to continue to be effective in its role as a development financial institution (DFI) thatsupports these strategic sectors. He points out that the bank has to keep up with rapid advances in high-technology industries so that it can continue to offer financialproducts that meet the demand of these industries. </p><p>In addition, DFIs are perhaps no longer the No.1 option when a high-risk business needs financing. Venture capital and debt securities have become reliable alternatives. </p><p>For Bank Industri, restructuring is a necessary response. Says chairman Tan Sri Othman Mohd Rijal, “We have to repair and clean our balance sheet, and address capitaladequacy issues. Of course, we next have to improve the bank’s organisational structure, processes and operations.” </p><p>The basis of the exercise is an ongoing review done jointly with professional service firm KPMG and Rating Agency Malaysia Bhd (RAM). A development that was instru-mental in pushing the bank towards some serious self-examination was the enactment of the Development Financial Institutions Act, which took effect in February 2002. </p><p>Following this, the bank and two main subsidiaries, Export-Import Bank of Malaysia Bhd (Exim Bank) and Malaysia Export CreditInsurance Bhd (Mecib), came under Bank Negara's supervision. Along with that came the inevitable comparison with other players in the banking sector. </p><p>At the same time, the government's push to reform GLCs, including the introduction of KPIs (key performance indicators), addsimpetus to Bank Industri's restructuring efforts. </p><p>“We welcome this initiative because it brings the management and direction of the business in line with what is stipulated in the act, which essentially emphasises goodmanagement, prudential risk management, and, of course, capital adequacy,” Othman explains. </p><p><b>The DFI difference</b> </p><p>When stacked up against, say, the country's commercial banks, Bank Industri looks very much like a poor cousin. The latter's risk-weighted capital ratio (RWCR) is -29% (a neg-ative ratio means that the capital base is insufficient to cover the assets, including loans) and its net non-performing loans (NPL) ratio as at June was 13.5%. </p><p>According to Bank Negara's July statistics, the commercial banks's RWCR and net NPL ratio stood at 14.2% and 5.8%. The overall banking system had a RWCR of 13.9% and anet NPL ratio of 6.2%. </p><p>However, because Bank Industri is a DFI, there is room to argue that it and commercial banks do not even belong to the same family. “In a way, we are a slightly different creature,” says Othman. </p><p>In a few ways, actually. To begin with, the bank was set up in 1979 to fill a gap in the financial system. Back then, commercial banks were reluctant – and understandably, still are – to take on the high risk thatcomes with lending to certain businesses in the maritime and manufacturing industries. </p><p>But these industries were deemed important to the nation's development goals, and thus DFIs like Bank Industri were required tofinance such businesses. Naturally, that has led to a loan portfolio that has a disproportionate amount of assets of lesser quality. </p><p>Says Othman, “If we were to apply prudence in the same way it is applied among commercial banks, we wouldn't be lending any-thing.” </p><p>Another key difference is that Bank Industri was left out in the restructuring of the banking sector in the wake of the Asian financial crisis. For example, it did notreceive capital injection from Danamodal Nasional Bhd. But it is clear that there is a need to address the bank's weak RWCR. </p><p>Indeed, the bank has sought fresh capital from the government – Minister of Finance (Inc) owns Bank Industri – and at one time, had apparently fancied its chances of getting a positive response. In a rating review published last March, RAM says it had been “given to understand” that the government had agreed to restore the RWCR toat least 8%. According to the rating agency, that would need a capital injection of about RM800mil. </p><p>“The government’s plan to recapitalise the bank is viewed positively by RAM, although we believe that it may take some time before the actual capital injection takes place,”says the report. </p><p>It will be a long wait. Bank Industri is now resigned to making do without recapitalisation by the government. Othman says the capital injection is not likely to happen because the government is now intent on balancing the budget. “I think we have to figure out ways how to repair the bank's capital structure ourselves.” </p><p><b>Floating to the top</b> </p><p>In that respect, it helps that Bank Industri has some useful investments on its books. Last December, for example, it unlocked substantial value when <a href=\"/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=MAYBULK\" target=\"_blank\">Malaysian Bulk Carriers Bhd</a><a href=\"http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=MAYBULK\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"go-chart\" src=\"https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png\"/></a> (a joint venture with the Kuokgroup) was floated on Bursa Malaysia's main board. </p><p>Through subsidiary Global Maritime Ventures Bhd (GMV), Bank Industri still holds over 20% in the shipping company. “It's alreadylisted and we will harvest the proceeds from there,” says Othman. </p><p>In addition, the bank is banking on gaining from the possible flotation of another shipping business. According to GMV's 2003 annual report, it operated 12 vessels injoint venture with Wawasan Shipping Sdn Bhd, a unit of the IMC group, which is controlled by shipping magnate Tan Sri Frank Tsao. </p><p>The listing proposal is still in the planning stages, but Bank Industri hopes to reap almost RM1bil in cash flow when it eventually disposes of its shares in the two shipping companies. </p><p>“That should bring us to a positive RWCR of 14% to 18%, depending on how we package the deals. That's way above the minimum BankNegara requirement of 8%,” Othman says. “We consider ourselves very lucky because we have made very good investments that are maturing at the right time.” But he concedesthat the bank cannot depend on Lady Luck to bail it out the next time. </p><p>He says because of the kind of lending it does and the portfolio it carries, it may well be back to square one in a matter of a few years. He adds that the bank shouldbe compensated by other measures if a capital injection is not forthcoming. </p><p>The RWCR formula is a source of contention. The bank's group managing director, Datuk Md Noor Yusoff says the formula requires thebank's investment in subsidiaries to be taken out of the bank's capital base. </p><p>He argues, “We have to create so many subsidiaries. Given our small capital, we have to borrow from the market to increase it. The ratio is negative, but we still continue our operations like normal. And theinvestments in the subsidiaries are still good investments.” </p><p>Othman takes a somewhat different approach. He views it as a positive that Bank Industri is included in the authorities' moves to strengthen the country's banking systemand culture. At the same time, he feels that Bank Industri's responsibility for supporting high-risk ventures has to be taken into account. </p><p>“The standards as applied by Bank Negara relates to the business of lending and finance. You can't use a different measurement. A measurement is a measurement. That's it. You've got to accept that. </p><p>“But when the subject matter doesn't really fit (into the framework of standards), you have to look into what can be done to remedythat at policy and structural levels.”When asked if the bank has figured out the remedial measures, Othman says this is being done as part of the strategic review. </p><p>“Whether the government will accept it (the bank's proposal) or whether it has other approaches, I wouldn't know.” </p><p><b>Related story:</b><a href=\"http://biz.thestar.com.my/bizweek/story.asp?file=/2004/9/11/bizweek/8866780&amp;sec=bizweek\" target=\"on_top\">A major role in the country's development</a> </p><p></p><p></p><p>\r\n",

      "<b></b><p>MALAYSIA will now focus on the development of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) after the successful implementation of Islamic banking and the development of the Islamic capital market in the last 20 years, Second Finance Minister Tan Sri Nor Mohamed Yakcop said. </p><p> NBFIs should be an important pillar in the third wave of development of the Islamic financial system, the first wave being Islamic banking and the second, the Islamic capital market,'' he said at an NBFI seminar on Islamic Alternatives in Kuala Lumpur yesterday. </p><p> Nor Mohamed said certain parts of NBFIs were already well established, such as Tabong Haji, while other components such as equities and Islamic private debt securities, takaful and the collection of personal zakat, had experienced encouraging growth in recent times. </p><p> Nonetheless, many other components of NBFIs have yet to be fully developed, particularly institutions such as waqf, inheritance management, micro credit and Qard Hassan, and corporate zakat.  </p><p> These are important and potentially powerful channels for change and we intend to give these aspects greater focus and attention because these institutions are not only complementary to Islamic banking but, indeed, form an integral part of the total Islamic financial system,'' he said. </p><p> Nor Mohamed said in developing the NBFIs, everyone had a role to play to ensure their success. </p><p> He said in addition to its regulatory role, the government and its agencies were committed to play an important part in kick-starting certain underdeveloped parts of the NBFI sector. </p><p> For example, there is considerable scope for work, through a more socio-economic and distributive focus, to further develop inheritance management, review the system of corporate zakat and revive the institutions waqf. Amanah Raya Bhd is expected to play an important role in these areas, he added. </p><p> As for the private sector, Nor Mohamed said participation would likely be in the promotion of waqf as well as in areas concerning intellectual and human capital, in funding original research and industry think tanks that constitute important public goods that would result in commercially rewarding knowledge and helping to shape responsible public policy. </p><p> At a press conference later, Bank Negara assistant governor Datuk Mohd Razif Abdul Kadir said Malaysia had attracted keen interest from foreign financial institutions to the three proposed Islamic banking licences, judging from the number of applications received before the closing date at the end of the month. </p><p> A lot of interest has been generated. We have to wait for the closing date on March 31 before deciding on the successful candidates, he said. </p><p> We will process those applications as soon as possible. Definitely (the three successful candidates will be announced) this year, he said. </p><p> Malaysia has three full-fledged Islamic banking institutions  Bank Islam (M) Bhd, Bank Muamalat (M) Bhd and Bank Rakyat (M) Bhd  and 13 conventional banks and four development financial institutions offering Islamic banking windows. </p><p></p><p></p><p>\r\n",

The DFIA was to ensure that the roles, objectives and activities of the DFIs are consistent with the government's objectives and that their mandated roles are efficiently and effectively implemented. </p><p> Newly appointed managing director Datuk Abdul Rahim Zin said the bank would continue with its traditional role of assisting small and medium enterprises and at the same time focusing its resources on infrastructure financing. </p><p> “We aim to be a leading financier in both SME and infrastructure development,” he told <i>StarBiz</i> in an interview.  </p><p></p><table align=\"left\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"7\" width=\"174\"> <tr><td> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/0E1406B2-DA43-4E4A-9D7E-4E89D55EE1C3\"/> </td></tr> <tr><td><div class=\"migration_caption\">Datuk Abdul Rahim Zin....BPIMB to continue assisting SMEs.</div></td></tr></table><p> He said, however, the bank would not be competing with other commercial banks for business, but rather, assist these projects should they be in a difficult position to raise funds. </p><p> “It is like a lender of last resort; we would come in when needed. Our rates are as competitive as those offered by other financial institutions,” he said. </p><p> In the past four years since venturing into this new area, the bank has seen its profitability grow by leaps and bounds, from RM97mil recorded in the financial year ended Dec 31, 1999, to RM279mil in financial year 2002. </p><p> Assets have soared from about RM5bil in 1999 to RM12bil in 2002, and then to more than RM13bil this year. </p><p> “We expect to see comparable results for this current financial year,” said Rahim, adding that the bank would strive to generate stable earnings from its activities, and not solely rely on the government for assistance. </p><p> On the development bank side, Rahim said the bank would continue helping bumiputra entrepreneurs raise their wealth profile. </p><p> As at Dec 31, 2002, the bank had extended loans worth RM1.75bil, with the majority of it going to the manufacturing sector, he said. </p><p> Since the bank's inception 30 years ago, it has helped groomed thousands of bumiputra businessmen in various sectors. </p><p> Some of the more successful ventures included second board auto components manufacturer Ingress Corp Bhd, Tracoma Bhd, and food-based industry such as Ramly Burger and Zara Foodstuff Industry Bhd. </p><p> Rahim, who took over the position from Tan Sri Dr Aris Othman, said the bank would implement a number of strategies in line with the focus to be a leading infrastructure lender. </p><p> He said the bank would enhance its risk management system for a more thorough credit rating on the exposure undertaken. </p><p> “We are getting technical assistance from JICA (Japan International Co-operation Agency) and also from our in-house programme in collaboration with Standard &amp; Poor's and other external consultants,” he said. </p><p> He said such risk management was needed considering the type of projects the bank was lending to. </p><p> As the bank's clients are mostly made up of the Muslim community, Rahim said, it was only natural that the bank progress further into Islamic banking. </p><p> “Our portfolio of Islamic lending is still quite small, in the region of 20% for development banking and only one or two in infrastructure financing,” he said. </p><p> He added that BPIMB would eventually move into corporate finance where it would undertake advisory role for the projects. </p><p> “Our involvement in corporate finance is quite small but there is ample room for growth,” he said. </p><p> On the development banking side, Rahim said a number of programmes had already been implemented, such as in the areas of training and advisory. </p><p> Being responsible for helping the bumiputra small businesses, the bank provides various technical training for start-ups and other businesses in various stages of growth. </p><p> “We also provide advisory services, like in what sort of machines or equipment to use in their business,” he said. </p><p> The bank has more than 600 lots of factory complexes in all 13 states which it is renting at very competitive rates. </p><p><b>Related Story:</b><a href=\"http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2003/12/15/business/6910163&amp;sec=business\">Rahim isn’t from same ‘old boy’ alumni</a> </p><p></p><p></p><p>\r\n",

Significantly, one-third of the issues have been taken up by multinationals. Moreover, almost 70% of the counters on the KLSE are Syariah-compliant. </p><p> Zeti said that in addition to the Islamic banking system, supporting financial infrastructure also needed to be put in place if the vast pool of Islamic funds currently invested in the traditional, conventional instruments was to be tapped. </p><p> She said: The development of non-bank financial intermediaries, such as development financial institutions, savings institutions and housing credit institutions, needs to be developed to meet customers' demands, she said, adding that other core components were the Islamic money market, the Islamic capital market and the takaful market. </p><p> Today, the Islamic money market has become an integral part of the Islamic financial system, with transactions of more than RM2bil a day and a broad spectrum of instruments, which include government investment issues, Bank Negara negotiable notes, Islamic accepted bills and Islamic private debt securities. New players, such as money brokers, have facilitated the development of this market.  </p><p> But, Zeti noted, the challenges facing the Islamic financial industry could be expected to be much more complex and demanding. This is because the regulatory framework in the Islamic financial industry needs to address the peculiar characteristics and attributes associated with Islamic banking operations and Islamic financial instruments. </p><p> She said the advent of Basel II that advocated a higher risk-focused regulatory approach would require the Islamic financial institutions to identify and unbundle the risks inherent in Islamic financial instruments.  </p><p> Players in the Islamic financial industry must, therefore, have in place robust risk management systems and practices. </p><p>  In this regard, she said, the establishment of the Islamic Financial Services Board, which had the mandate of developing prudent standards in accordance with unique features of Islamic financial institutions, was timely. </p><p></p><p></p><p>\r\n",

Therefore, a lot of people resort to moneylenders and get into trouble,” Dr Mahathir said.  </p><p> Incentives for low and medium-cost housing are one of the measures to reduce the gap between “those that have and those that have less.”  </p><p> Under the “Home Ownership for the People” (HOPE) project, the Government will be granting subsidies, interest-free loans, cash payment and tax relief especially for first-time and new housebuyers. </p><p> Syarikat Perumahan Negara Bhd will build an additional 150,000 low and medium-cost homes with priority given to single mothers to purchase them. </p><p> To provide greater flexibility on foreign equity participation, the Foreign Investment Committee (FIC) guidelines will be further liberalised; so will equity conditions for companies, especially foreign ones, seeking listing on the KLSE. </p><p> Besides looking into the cost of doing business, the Government has come up with incentives aimed at improving competitiveness. They involve pioneer status, investment tax allowance and tax incentives for companies doing international trading as well as for hypermarkets and direct-selling companies exporting locally-produced goods. </p><p> Measures to enhance human resource development include greater flexibility in hiring foreign workers with automatic approvals for highly-skilled workers where no local expertise is available. </p><p> On how the Government will fund its portion, Dr Mahathir said it can bear up to RM1.7bil and banks are expected to raise funds via issue of bonds which, he hopes, will be subscribed by cash-rich funds and organisations. </p><p> On the effectiveness of the package, he hopes everyone will support it and that the unions will not protest against the measures.  </p><p><b>Full speech (in Bahasa Malaysia)</b></p><p><a href=\"http://www.smpke.jpm.my/WebNotesApp/PMMain.nsf/hv_PMKiniSemasa/561814C1FC9B5A2148256D2D002E6B45\">From the website of the PM's Office</a></p><p><a href=\"http://thestar.com.my/news/archives/story.asp?ppath=\\2003\\5\\20&amp;file=/2003/5/20/business/wsstimulus&amp;sec=business\" target=\"on_top\">Why the government is taking this initiative and outlook for the Malaysian economy</a><img alt=\"video\" border=\"0\" height=\"9\" src=\"/images/video.gif\" width=\"13\"/> <a href=\"http://202.186.86.35/mmedia/video/sars_030521.rm\" target=\"on_top\">Real player</a> l  <a href=\"http://202.186.86.35/mmedia/video/sars_030521.asf\" target=\"on_top\">Media player</a><img alt=\"video\" border=\"0\" height=\"9\" src=\"/images/video.gif\" width=\"13\"/> <a href=\"http://202.186.86.35/mmedia/video/borrowing_030521.rm\" target=\"on_top\">Real player</a> l  <a href=\"http://202.186.86.35/mmedia/video/borrowing_030521.asf\" target=\"on_top\">Media player</a><img alt=\"video\" border=\"0\" height=\"9\" src=\"/images/video.gif\" width=\"13\"/> <a href=\"http://202.186.86.35/mmedia/video/recouping_030521.rm\" target=\"on_top\">Real player</a> l  <a href=\"http://202.186.86.35/mmedia/video/recouping_030521.asf\" target=\"on_top\">Media player</a><img alt=\"video\" border=\"0\" height=\"9\" src=\"/images/video.gif\" width=\"13\"/> <a href=\"http://202.186.86.35/mmedia/video/funding_030521.rm\" target=\"on_top\">Real player</a> l  <a href=\"http://202.186.86.35/mmedia/video/funding_030521.asf\" target=\"on_top\">Media player</a><img alt=\"video\" border=\"0\" height=\"9\" src=\"/images/video.gif\" width=\"13\"/> <a href=\"http://202.186.86.35/mmedia/video/stimulus_030521.rm\" target=\"on_top\">Real player</a> l  <a href=\"http://202.186.86.35/mmedia/video/stimulus_030521.asf\" target=\"on_top\">Media player</a></p><p><a href=\"http://biz.thestar.com.my/\">More reports in Star Business</a>  </p><p><b>Related Stories:</b><a href=\"http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2003/5/22/nation/aetour&amp;sec=nation\">Boost for tourism sector</a> <a href=\"http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2003/5/22/nation/dihousing&amp;sec=nation\">Incentives for housebuyers</a> <a href=\"http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2003/5/22/nation/fbhyper21&amp;sec=nation\">Incentives will put local products on international market</a> <a href=\"http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2003/5/22/nation/llpakej&amp;sec=nation\">Stimulus to be felt in three months, says Abdullah</a> <a href=\"http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2003/5/22/nation/lrpackage21&amp;sec=nation\">House Buyers Association: Package will encourage ownership</a><a href=\"http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2003/5/22/nation/mucont&amp;sec=nation\">Cuepacs welcomes bonus and 2% EPF reduction</a><a href=\"http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2003/5/22/nation/ihcab&amp;sec=nation\">Perk means little, say cabbies</a><a href=\"http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2003/5/22/nation/rifongcash&amp;sec=nation\">RM600mil more for training</a> </p><p></p><p></p><p>\r\n",

      "<div align=\"RIGHT\"></div><b>BY HANIM ADNAN</b><p>THE Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) has proposed that the banking sector benchmark themselves against their regional and international counterparts to ensure that their cost of borrowings is competitive. </p><p> This, in turn, would ensure that Malaysian companies were cost competitive when they compete globally, the FMM said in its memorandum to the Finance Ministry on the Budget Dialogue 2004 in Putrajaya yesterday. </p><p> FMM said the margins enjoyed by banks continued to be high given the difference between deposit rates and the base lending rate. </p><p> FMM also proposed alternative forms of collateral for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which could include one or a combination of the following: </p><p> ·Confirmed sales proceeds, </p><p> ·Factoring  allowing SMEs to factor invoices at identified financial windows, </p><p> ·Guarantees from purchasers, </p><p> ·Second charge on property or assets, </p><p> ·Feasibility studies by pre-agreed consultants or special unit, and </p><p> ·Guarantees from directors or holding companies. </p><p> It suggested that as an incentive to financial institutions providing loans with alternative collateral, interest income from such loans be exempt from tax. </p><p> It also proposed that the various SME funds allocate RM500mil to financial institutions (FIs) at a cost of 1.5% which can be extended as credit to SMEs at 3%, with the FIs earning a margin of 1.5%. </p><p> FMM has proposed that the government, development financial institutions and FIs provide fixed, long-term interest rate loans for 20-30 year periods for the purchase of assets, factories and expansion of projects. </p><p> In addition, variable interest rates that increase over the loan repayment period consistent with the growth profile of the company would also ease the financial burden of SMEs. The average rate of interest over the life of the loan should not exceed 4%. </p><p> To bridge the funding requirements of SMEs, they should either be provided with seed capital or debt support on terms less demanding than financial institutions, particularly during the initial years. </p><p> There was also a need to standardise loan documents and business plans, FMM said. </p><p> Designing a template for loan documents and business plans would assist in lowering the cost of borrowing for SMEs and facilitate the refinancing of loans when financial market conditions, in particular interest rates, change. </p><p> Such templates could be designed jointly by Small and Medium Industries Development Corp in consultation with Bank Negara, Association of Banks and FMM.  </p><p></p><p></p><p>\r\n",

      "<div align=\"RIGHT\"></div><b>BY JAGDEV SINGH SIDHU</b><p> </p><p> THE Association of Banks Malaysia (ABM) sees the new monetary and administrative measures announced by Bank Negara as further proactive steps towards maintaining economic growth, supporting business activity and implementing the Financial Services Masterplan. </p><p> As it noted, the focus is on strengthening the domestic economy through better coordinated delivery and allocation of more funds to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), relaxing the requirements for foreign companies to raise funds locally, and improving the effectiveness of development financial institutions (DFIs).  </p><p> ABM chairman Dr Rozali Mohamed Ali said in a statement yesterday that the central bank had rightly emphasised the need to enhance the level of professionalism in the financial services sector through the establishment of the International Centre for Leadership and Excellence in Finance. </p><p> At the same time, the consumer education programme will be developed to increase awareness of consumers rights and the service levels that should be expected from financial institutions, he noted. </p><p> Economists, meanwhile, see the lowered economic growth forecast of 4.5% for this year as a realistic figure, though this is dependent on what the private sector does. </p><p> And they have not ruled out a cut in interest rates, saying that comments from Bank Negara on Wednesday indicated it was reserving that flexibility should economic conditions worsen. </p><p> There were a lot of caveats in the 4.5% growth estimate, said CIMB economist Lee Heng Guie. But the message is that the government is consolidating and the private sector has to act. </p><p> Economists say it is crucial that the private sector loosens its purse strings as the government would be consolidating its position by spending a little less than previously. </p><p> Estimates are that the private sectors consumption would grow  by 6.9% and private investment by 8.1%.  Greater reliance on the private sector to start spending money comes on the heels of a 3.6% increase in public sector expenditure this year after growing by 8.6% last year. </p><p> Comparing these two sets of official numbers, the downward revision (of the growth forecast) reflects mainly the concern of Iraq war uncertainty and weaker-than-expected global economic conditions, said DBS Bank senior economist Wong Chee Seng. </p><p> Domestically, the numbers suggest that demand conditions remain relatively resilient with real aggregate demand growing by 5.9% versus 4.3% last year. </p><p> Some economists say such private sector growth, although possible, could be difficult in light of global uncertainties.  Private investment had shown positive growth in recent quarters and manufacturing applications had grown by 35% last year. </p><p> An economist with a local brokerage said companies might be hesitant to invest as the capacity utilisation rate had been coming down and there was still a lot of excess capacity. Also, global uncertainties could see some companies postponing planned investments until a clearer outlook emerged, he added. </p><p> Strains on private sector consumption are emerging, some economists say, as the rate of non-performing loans for residential houses has risen and consumers tend to be cautious in an uncertainty environment.  </p><p> On the other hand, job security, based on the low unemployment rate, high agricultural product prices and historical low interest rates, are factors that would push consumption higher.  </p><p></p><p></p><p>\r\n",

It was envisaged that that at the end of this phase, a core of strong domestic players would emerge and the gap between foreign and core banking institutions would be narrowed. </p><p> The thrust of financial policies this year would be to further enhance the position of domestic financial institutions to meet the more competitive environment that would emerge from the gradual liberalisation and deregulation which would take place during the second phase of FSMP. </p><p> It was envisaged that at the end of Phase 1, a core of strong domestic players would emerge and the gap between foreign and core banking institutions would be narrowed, Bank Negara said. </p><p> Among the completed recommendations were in the banking and insurance sectors, Islamic banking and takaful, development financial institutions (DFIs), alternative modes of financing and the Labuan International Offshore Financial Centre (IOFC). </p><p> As envisioned in the FSMP, the future financial landscape will be characterised by an increasingly more diversified financial sector to meet the requirements of a changing economic structure. </p><p> Efforts were also on enhancing the innovative capability, efficiency and market orientation of the IOFC. Last year, eight new banks, including two Saudi Arabian Islamic investment banks, were approved to operate in Labuan. </p><p> A total of 486 new offshore companies were incorporated last year versus 364 in 2001, up 33.5%. </p><p> The central bank said one of the strategic foci for the Labuan IOFC was to promote Islamic products and services given the growing interest in <i>syariah-</i>based financial and services products in the global financial market.  </p><p><a href=\"http://www.bnm.gov.my/en/Publications/ar.asp?yr=2002\" target=\"_blank\">Direct to the Bank Negara Report</a></p><p></p><p>\r\n",

      "when prime minister tan sri muhyiddin yassin announced his stimulus package it appeared at first glance a commendable even an impressive feat by his government to respond to the covid19 pandemic however two key points merit assessment of the perikatan nasional government’s response to this crisis first when muhyiddin addressed the nation remarkably enough he began by admitting that his “government may not be the government you voted for” this was an astonishing admission by the prime minister that he was aware many malaysians question the legitimacy of his perikatan government the second point was his resolve to use governmentlinked companies glcs to deal with the crisis this too was an intriguing admission that he as prime minister had control of powerful businessrelated governmentlinked institutions that he could deploy during this crisis indeed finance minister tengku zafrul abdul aziz would later draw reference to a “government ecosystem” according to the finance minister “direct fiscal injection” would come “from government agencies and related parties” in this ecosystem zafrul was not clear though of the source of borrowings by the government to fund this stimulus package muhyiddin’s admission of his control of major glcs that have funds and other resources to support people and businesses in need was an indication of two core matters first malaysia is a highly interventionist state with a welldeveloped institutional architecture to stimulate the economy and protect the interests of people in need second a politicalbusiness nexus is in place in government with the power that comes from such ties concentrated in the hands of the prime minister this influential ecosystem created in the 1970s to resolve social injustices though now critiqued as a moneypower nexus has long remained in the shadows in spite of repeated public demand for transparency about this “government ecosystem” no prime minister has been willing to do so even after the economic crises in 1997 and 2008 in this time of the covid19 crisis there is a particular need to analyse how this powerful politicalbusiness nexus is being – or not being – employed in this stimulus package what muhyiddin and zafrul referred to as glcs it must be stressed includes much more than publiclisted companies controlled by the government such as the utilitiesbased tenaga nasional and telecom and the financialbased maybank cimb rhb bank and bank islam this ecosystem includes pension and savings funds such as epf and pnb statutory bodies like mara and felda and development financial institutions or dfis such as sme bank exim bank and agro bank the prime minister has stated though with little clarity how some of these glcs will be employed tenaga nasional along with the government according to muhyiddin will offer a discount on power consumption that will amount to rm530mil telecommunications firms will offer free internet services with the government allocating rm600mil for this presumably glcs in these sectors will absorb these costs as for the glc banks they will offer loan moratoriums though this will not mean huge losses for them as these are merely deferred payments epf though a pension fund will allow for withdrawals to help people meet their expenses during this crisis most of these measures as well as other aspects of the stimulus package have already begun to draw much criticism why for example in this health related crisis have the glcbased hospitals not been included in this stimulus package glc hospitals such as kpj and pantai as well as those controlled by sime darby were not mentioned though muhyiddin called on private hospitals to help the government and what of pharmaceuticalsbased pharmaniaga as well as uemedgenta which provide healthrelated services indeed uemedgenta has been criticised for not treating its workers well during this pandemic there is no need for these major health financial and utilitiesbased glcs to worry about registering huge profits other criticisms have emerged particularly involving epf ngos have admonished the government for calling on malaysians especially those in the b40 to use their meagre savings to share responsibility to reflate the economy the sme association has reacted badly to the stimulus package claiming that 50 of such firms will wind down with at least four million people losing their jobs these smes constitute about 98 of the corporate sector since the finance minister has stated that the stimulus package will entail a reallocation of funds among governmentlinked agencies other related issues arise why not reallocate funds in dfis such as sme bank midf bank pembangunan and exim bank to small and micro firms which are in dire need to remain afloat why not employ agro bank and bank rakyat to help rural industries to ensure continued food production and supply and what about statutory bodies such as mara kesedar ketengah risda and felcra created to support small and rural industries these institutions have in fact been long abused for patronage and distribution of concessions to obtain political support indeed soon after the perikatan government took power it changed the board of directors of mara which has oversight of a huge business base there is a wellframed institutional architecture in this government ecosystem that has been used in the past to allow the government to intervene in the economy to achieve noble goals these businessrelated government institutions can be employed to get help quickly to the ground during this crisis there is however little indication in this stimulus package that the prime minister is using this government ecosystem effectively to deal with this pandemic in fact while trying to channel funds to people to increase consumption to sustain the economy the government appears equally preoccupied with helping major glcs remain profitable keeping a powerful politicalbusiness nexus in placeafter all the prime minister himself admitted in his speech he also has to deal with a political crisis if ever there was a time to expose this powerful glc world and for politicians to dispense with using this power nexus to consolidate their position in government it is now importantly too since this shadow government’s ecosystem will be deployed to fuel the economy by an administration whose legitimacy is in question it is imperative that parliament be convened to debate this stimulus package prof terence gomez specialises in political economy and is the dean of the economics and administration faculty at universiti malaya the views expressed here are entirely the writer’s own\r\n",

      "pressure is mounting on the pakatan harapan government to prove its mettle after the country recorded its worst growth rate since the global financial crisis a decade ago economists have warned that the malaysian economy may continue to grow in the range of 3 in the first quarter of 2020 1q20 or even the first half 1h20  a far cry from the 61 growth seen in 3q17 the biggest threats facing the domestic economy in 2020 are the continued slowdown in the global economy and trade a prolonged novel coronavirus covid19 outbreak and commodity supply disruptions these threats coupled with weak business sentiment could weigh on growth further in 2020  for context the business conditions index as measured by the malaysian institute of economic research continues to be below the “optimism threshold” since the final quarter of 2018 ocbc bank economist wellian wiranto expects a 35 growth in 1q20 while alliance bank malaysia bhd chief economist manokaran mottain forecasts a growth of about 3 meanwhile maybank investment bank group chief economist suhaimi ilias predicts a sub4 growth in 1h20 before rebounding to above 4 in 2h20 this is assuming the outbreak is contained by june 2020manokaran expects the fiscal deficit to rise to 37 in 2020 exceeding the government’s target in view of such challenges a stimulus package in the form of higher government spending and investments is a much needed catalyst to avert further economic slowdown finance minister lim guan eng said in a statement yesterday that prime minister tun dr mahathir mohamad will announce an economic stimulus package on feb 27 in response to the impact from the covid19 outbreak he adds that the economic stimulus package is neither a new budget nor part of budget 2020 measures instead assistance will be given to the affected sectors to allow the economy to emerge as whole as possible and benefit from the expected economic rebound postcovid19 according to lim the emphasis of the stimulus package would be on exploring alternative revenues such as shifting towards encouraging domestic tourism and sourcing from other markets“this also involves keeping the domestic labour market resilient while ensuring our soft and physical infrastructure remain in place amid the shortterm weakened demand ” lim says a fiscal stimulus if properly applied to the relevant sectors would improve market sentiment spur local demand and reduce economic losses caused by covid19 and the uschina trade war the problem is a fiscal stimulus on top of the government’s budget 2020 would strain the government’s cash flow and result in higherthanexpected fiscal deficit the government had previously forecast a 3 fiscal deficit level in 2020 but had later revised it to 32 malaysian rating corp bhd chief economist nor zahidi alias describes the move to contain fiscal deficit and introduce a stimulus package as a “delicate balancing act” while he concurs that fiscal consolidation measures are important to ensure the country’s sovereign rating is not compromised he says that a slightly higher deficit ratio during times like this will not hurt the economy “rating agencies normally rate through the cycle and look at sovereign rating from a holistic angle – if the slowdown affects the global economy then they will see this as an ‘unexpected event’ in this case it is unlikely that sovereign ratings will be affected ” he tells starbizweek alliance bank’s manokaran expects the fiscal deficit to rise to 37 in 2020 exceeding the government’s targetnor zahidi move to contain fiscal deficit and introduce stimulus package a ‘delicate balancing act’ “the government does not have to worry about fiscal deficit as many governments will inject more funds into the economy “most of them will not be able to keep their target ” he says on the government’s fiscal stimulus package manokaran expects the value to be about rm7 bil to rm10bil manokaran has suggested several measures to be included under the fiscal stimulus package among which are gt temporary reduction of the sales and service tax by half to 3 gt providing a voluntary option to cut employees’ contribution by at least 2 to the employees provident fund gt increasing the tax claim for sponsorship of arts cultural and heritage activities in malaysia that could indirectly attract more tourists gt government agencies and departments could hold conferences and meetings in hotels and resorts especially those with 3 and 4star ratings back in 2003 thethen government had introduced a stimulus package of rm73bil to deal with the economic impacts of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic under the stimulus package only 23 or rm17bil was funded by the federal government with the balance contributed by bank negara and development financial institutions such as bank simpanan nasional and bank pembangunan through micro credit schemes under various loan programmes with such an approach alliancedbs research says in a note the government’s fiscal position was not materially impacted the support to the economy is not entirely reliant on the government’s fiscal strength it also depends on the central bank’s ability to flex its muscles bank negara governor datuk nor shamsiah mohd yunus recently hinted at a possibility of cutting the overnight policy rate further pointing out that the central bank has ample room for monetary policy adjustmentssuhaimi points out that the economy will continue to see commodity supply disruption in q1 economists anticipate more rate cuts this year in the range of 25 to 50 basis points bps following a 25bps cut made earlier on jan 22 to 275  the lowest level since 2011the 4q19 economic performance the economic outlook has turned cloudier as the country merely reported a 36 growth for 4q19 much below the market prediction of 41 as for the fullyear 2019 growth was registered at 43  the lowest since 2009 and under the government’s target of 47 however in an attempt to calm market fears nor shamsiah has insisted that the economy would have grown by 47 in 2019 and 43 in 4q19  if not for commodity supply disruptions for perspective palm oil production contracted by 169 yearonyear yoy in 4q19 natural gas production was down by 21 yoy while crude oil output remained in contraction of 5 yoy nor shamsiah also said that the economy continued to be supported by “resilient private sector spending” and “the expansion in the services and manufacturing sectors” private consumption which is the key support to the economy saw a stronger growth of 81 in 4q19 as compared to 7 in 3q19 meanwhile public consumption inched up marginally by 13 in 4q19 from 1 in the third quarter  as for investments public investments continued to contract albeit at a smaller decline of 77 in 4q19 however private investment posted a big jump with a 42 growth in the final quarter from just 03 in 3q19 commenting on the private investment trend wellian of ocbc bank has cautioned against reading exclusively on the yearonyear growth rate “at 42 yoy in the fourth quarter the private investment does appear to have picked up considerably from 03 of 3q19 but in terms of contribution to headline growth investment activities still pose a net drag namely negative contribution of 016 percentage point albeit an improvement from 092 percentage point of the previous quarter “even as foreign direct investment inflow has been encouraging especially into the technology cluster domestic investment activities appear to be still relatively subdued ” he sayseconomic forecast wiranto

believes the low production situation will normalise beyond the first quarter on net exports nor zahidi of marc expects it to continue exert pressure on the economic growth in 1q20 as the tourism sector takes a hit postcovid 19 outbreak “expenditures by foreigners or tourists in malaysia are considered as exports of goods and services ” he says in 4q19 net exports declined by 98 after a growth

      "kuala lumpur bank pembangunan malaysia bhd bpmb and danajamin nasional bhd have received the approval of bank negara to commence negotiations under the first phase of the government’s proposed merger involving the country’s development financial institutions dfis bpmb in a statement said that negotiations between the two dfis are expected to be completed within six months from bank negara’s approval in budget 2020 the government had proposed to merge four dfis namely bpmb danajamin exportimport bank of malaysia bhd exim bank and small medium enterprise development bank malaysia bhd sme bank to strengthen the development finance ecosystem via a twophased restructuring plan to form a new financial institution the first phase of the restructuring plan will involve the merger of bpmb with danajamin and the second phase to merge exim bank and sme bank into the earlier merged entity the smooth implementation of the restructuring plan would be overseen by a steering committee led by the finance ministry the steering committee consists of representatives from credit guarantee corp malaysia bhd bank negara and the four dfis as well as relevant stakeholder ministries including the economic affairs ministry the entrepreneur development ministry and the international trade and industry ministry meanwhile a working committee which would provide updates on the merger progress would also support the steering committee in driving the implementation of the key integration aspects of the merger given the expected merger of the four dfis a banking analyst from kenanga research told starbiz that the merger is expected to largely tap the financing for entrepreneurs as well as smes driven by bpmb’s mandate to provide medium and longterm financing to the strategic sectors of the economy “right now getting financing for the sme sector is tough given the weak business sentiment “hence conventional banks see the sme market and unsecured businesses as high risk to provide financing “however this merger would extend its financing to the sme business which is a big market as it faces difficulty in getting financing from conventional banks ” he added overall sme lending is seeing faster growth than total loan growth this year according to midf research senior analyst imran yassin bpmb was incorporated in 1973 with the role of assisting entrepreneurs involved in sme industries through the provision of various financing facilities training and advisory services particularly to bumiputra entrepreneursthrough its wholly owned subsidiary pembangunan leasing corp sdn bhd plc bpmb also provides financing to sme businesses including those involved in manufacturing construction supply transportation agriculture hospitality and information technology as of dec 312018 bpmb had a combined asset value of rm247bil reflecting that the group is wellpositioned to meet the financing and business development needs of malaysian businesses in the priority sectors with the global economy slowing down the analyst noted that merging danajamin could be useful in the merger as the bank would be able to capitalise the banking system should there be a rise in nonperforming loans moving forward “this merger would strengthen the capital adequacy ratio so it can continue to expand its lending to the sme sector and unsecured businesses ” he added the government’s proposal to merge four dfis in the country could create an entity with a larger balance sheet that in turn could result in greater efficiencies and better cost controls however with these institutions serving different mandates the operational side would be something that the government would need to address according to industry players another likely issue that could crop up with the proposed merger is staffing where there will bound to be duplications and overlaps in some operations postmerger finance minister lim guan eng said in his budget 2020 presentation that dfis played an important role as public institutions that support the nation’s development goals and serve the needs and requirements of the new economy the possible merger of local dfis in malaysia’s already crowded and competitive banking space had been discussed sometime back but did not take off previously in a statement issued by bpmb it said that the proposal to strengthen the dfi ecosystem is a “positive development” “our business lines are complementary to the other institutions and the proposal will lead to greater synergies that would benefit all stakeholders as well as fulfil the needs of the new economy ” it added dfis in malaysia were established in the 1960s and 1970s as specialised financial institutions with specific mandates to develop strategic sectors spanning agriculture infrastructure smes as well as exportoriented and hightechnology industries notably in 2008 sme bank was made a separate entity from its parent company the bpmb group for the year ended dec 312018 bpmb’s net profit fell 215 to rm16731mil due to higher allowance for impairment losses on loans and financing of rm42322mil versus rm30278mil a year earlier last year bank negara collaborated with the world bank and dfis to develop an enhanced performance measurement framework for dfis the central bank said it sought to provide a sharper focus in the mandates of dfis while optimising performance and synergies it aims to capture the broader contributions of dfis by moving beyond the narrow focus of financing growth indicators and integrating developmental key performance indicators to measure the socioeconomic impact of dfi operations\r\n",

      "                a week before the tabling of budget 2020 this column highlighted that the budget will likely be a nonevent as far as the market is concerned for the simple reason that the government’s finances are tight and it cannot simply afford the many wishes of the wide range of stakeholderswhile economic projections came within expectations especially with respect to the budget deficit target of 32 and development expenditure of rm56bil the projected revenue and expenditure were off by 4 each as they came in higher than expectednevertheless the projected current balance of rm35bil was just slightly above the forecast rm3bilthe budget 2020 tabled last week is looking at economic growth of 48 which is within the expected range of between 45 and 5 it will be challenging given the expected growth is to be mainly driven by private consumption smaller contraction in public investment and but dragged by a drop in net exports as imports growth is expected to surpass exports next year on the supply side the significant contribution from the construction sector growth is not a surprise given some of the mega projects will likely kick off next year while the services sector too is expected to be sustained at more than 6 growthbudget 2020 had several hits and misses while it raised minimum wage to rm1200 it is still short of the rm1500 targetat the same time the call to widen the tax revenue base was not fulfilled the introduction of a new tax bracket of 30 for high income earners of above rm2mil a year is insufficient as it is only an incremental increase of two percentage points the finance minister failed to introduce or at least prepare malaysians to accept new taxes especially inheritance tax and capital gains taxthe property market got a major boost with the lowering of the threshold price to rm600000 from rm1mil for completed high rise condominiums and apartments that can be sold to foreign buyers beginning next year for a period of one yearhopefully this would help developers sitting on these types of properties and to clear the existing overhang in the market in addition the renttoown scheme is good for firsttime home buyers while the change in the base year for the purposes of real property gains tax rpgt to the year 2013 from 2000 is a welcome relief although still not widely accepted for administrative purposes it is always better to calculate rpgt to the year the property is purchased and not any base year as valuation of a property at a given point of time in history is very subjectivebudget 2020 was a positive surprise for those in the technology and in the electrical and electronics eampe sector while the sin sectors were obviously sparred this time around with the exception of a reduction in special draws for the number forecasting operators nfo the proposed merger of the four development financial institutions dfi was another surprise and hopefully when that is done the merged entity will be the next mega ipo to be listed on bursa malaysiafor the environment as well as to promote green initiatives the proposals made under the budget are indeed welcome and could spur renewal energy further with the target to achieve 20 of energy production by 2025 the introduction of a 70 income tax exemption of up to 10 years to companies undertaking solar leasing activities could spur higher demand among consumersbut this could only happen if prices of solar panels became more attractive and the cost savings from the income tax reliefs are actually passed on to consumers the problem among consumers is the upfront cost of putting up solar panels on their roofs as it can be as high as almost rm4000 per kw peak or kwpmalaysia is also expected to see an accelerated pace of investments flowing into the country as the government’s move to establish a special channel via investkl to attract investments from china is seen positive despite a temporary truce to the uschina trade war over the weekend nothing is certain just yet as to how the trade tariffs will pan out over the next few weeks placing malaysia as a destination of choice for foreign direct investments is crucial as it signals our readiness in attracting long term investments which can create job opportunities and generate economic expansion the setting up of the national committee on investment nci is also a step in the right direction to spur and expedite inward investment activitiesthe budget 2020 was indeed a comprehensive document covering all malaysians and indeed what better way than to focus on two main critical issues – cost of living and jobsthe budget did not fail in this aspect as there were various incentives to address cost of living issues including the newly introduced fuel subsidy mechanism a free rm30 ewallet deposit into accounts of entitled persons and last but not least a 18 reduction for plus highway users effective new year’s day next yearthe toll issue has dragged on for far too long and with the tabling of the budget 2020 we are now seeing some light at the end of the tunnel when the minister highlighted that the 18 reduction in toll translates to about rm113bil it seems to suggest that the current shareholders of plus the epf and khazanah are likely to forgo any future dividends with the reductionwith the commitment from the government that extension period for toll concessionaires is not going to be extended it is likely the two or three proposals that are siting on the desk of the minister or the prime minister will continue to collect dusttheir proposals while entailing even larger discounts than that proposed by the minister lack the commitment to end tolling in 2038 hence it is likely that their proposals are not going to see the light of day given the unspoken line it is now likely that either khazanah or the epf to take the lead to buy out one or the other logically as the ability to pay dividends to shareholders has now be diminished it would make sense for khazanah to acquire the 49 not already owned from epfall in the budget 2020 was a comprehensive document towards the government’s new mantra towards shared prosperity vision 2030 it was

available under the renttoown scheme from rm300000 to rm500000 as this will give firsttime homebuyers more options to choose from the increase in the allocation for the scheme from rm1bil to rm10bil including a guarantee of rm3bil by the government shows that the government sees home ownership as a very critical issue for the rakyat however it is noted that under the current scheme only rm1562mil worth of loans was approved we hope the lending guidelines and criteria will be reviewed especially for firsttime homebuyers for them to benefit from the scheme the reduction of the foreign ownership threshold value for unsold stocks of condominiums and apartments located in city areas from rm1mil to rm600000 will help to reduce the overhang for these type of properties as developers can market

revising the base year for property acquired at jan 12013 for assets acquired before jan 12013 as compared to the previous base year of jan 12000 will allow sellers to pay lower rpgt the announcement of the new renttoown scheme is favourable towards first time home buyers who are facing difficulties in coming up with the initial 10 down payment and securing endfinancing as it serves as an

decades ago in 1991 to celebrate malaysia joining the ranks of developed nations vision 2020 would have succeeded if not for the massive financial scandals corruption and mismanagement of the previous government 5 the first pakatan harapan budget tabled in 2018 focused on fiscal consolidation and rationalisation institutional reforms and peoplecentric policies to right the many wrongs of the previous administration for this budget the theme is on “driving growth and equitable outcomes towards shared prosperity” the government is committed to bringing stability to the government’s finances and achieving the goal of vision 2020 with a new growth trajectory under the foundation of “shared prosperity vision 2030” as initiated by yab prime minister tun dr mahathir bin mohamad economic performance and challenges tan sri speaker sir 6 the global economy has been thrown into a state of uncertainty caused by the trade war between the united states and other nations especially the people’s republic of china the international monetary fund imf has revised downwards the global economic growth forecast for the year 2019 from 39 in july 2018 to 32 in july 2019 the world trade organisation wto has also reduced the forecast for world merchandise trade growth for 2019 from 26 in april 2019 to 12 in october 2019 the lowest since 2009 7 as a trading nation malaysia cannot avoid being affected by these external headwinds however with economic policies and reforms implemented by the pakatan harapan government our economy will remain resilient in the first half of 2019 gdp growth was 47 with a growth rate of 49 in the 2nd quarter indeed malaysia is one of the few economies in the world that experienced faster growth in the second quarter compared to the previous quarter 8 the government has also been very successful in taming inflation with 02 recorded in the first half of 2019 compared to 10 and 37 for the whole of 2018 and 2017 respectively clearly the goods and services tax gst implemented under the previous regime had contributed significantly to higher prices by abolishing the gst of 6 in june 2018 and replacing it with the sales and services tax sst regime in september 2018 the country’s inflation rate has been reduced to its lowest levels since 2007 for the full year of 2019 the inflation rate is expected to be at 09 to respect the mandate given

by 04 from a year ago malaysian exports are still expected to record positive growth for 2019 during the same period malaysia recorded rm925 billion worth of trade surplus which is 287 larger than the rm719 billion recorded during the same period in 2018 10 this healthy trade balance will keep the country’s current account in surplus for the year overall malaysia’s balance of payments continues to

electronics chain store senheng electric kl sdn bhd over the years no stranger to turbulent times its founder and managing director lim kim heng shares the six transformations senheng has undergone to stay competitive in the market among the most notable was its 2002 move to a fixed price model lim wanted to kickstart an aggressive expansion plan but was limited due to the lack of talents skilled in price negotiation he went against the current to launch fixed prices for senheng’s products   the backlash was instantaneous with business falling 25 in the first and second months continuing well into its fifth month to turn the tide lim introduced a loyalty card concept which saw double digit sales growth for 11 years consecutively  “before we launched fixed prices there was no trust at all between customers and the shops there’s no way to build trust if we’re both cheating each other which was why i insisted on building loyalty to change the conversation from purchasing products for discounts to features” he says along the way he launched senq to target a different market the shift to online shopping in 2014 also prompted further changes as senheng’s business dropped 6 to 7 for three consecutive years  taking it in stride he did his research and implemented several digital transformation initiatives culminating in the 2017’s launch of a new retail concept he calls seamless

      "as part of ongoing efforts to promote continued access to financing for small and medium enterprises smes bank negara conducted a survey in 2018 to obtain a better understanding of the financing needs and behaviour of smes according to bank negara’s annual report 2018 a total of 1529 formal sme businesses participated in the survey which covered firm and entrepreneur characteristics business performance and challenges as well as access to finance and usage of financial services “the survey showed that more than 90 of the smes served the domestic market with 7 exporting their products and services about 83 of smes reported utilising information and communications technology ict in their business operations with 22 that have their own website and 14 that operate online stores “more than half of the respondents 53 used professional services including auditors accountants or financial advisors to manage their financial accounts” says the central bank despite the challenging business environment in the first quarter of 2018 the majority of smes 71 recorded profit margins of above 10 and were able to maintain positive cash flows says bank negara “manufacturing firms reported higher levels of productivity and paid higher wages for new graduate hires compared to other sectors” on financing the central bank says respondents reported utilising funds from a variety of sources both internal and external with own cash contributions being the main source “among other funding sources about 27 of the respondents had facilities with financial institutions followed by family and friends internallygenerated funds and microfinance institutions “in the microenterprise segment 22 had financing facilities with financial institutions including 9 of respondents who secured financing under the pembiayaan mikro facility” bank negara says sources of financing also vary through the business life cycle “at the initial stage young firms tend to rely on their own cash and informal sources such as family and friends this is consistent with most research findings which attribute such behaviour typical of young firms to information opacity lack of collateral track record and financial skills as well as high transactional costs “as businesses mature typically after five years in operation they tend to rely more on external financing in the form of both debt and equity including bank financing” among the smes that had applied for financing most indicated that they were able to secure financing says the central bank  “about 22 of the respondents had applied for financing in the six months prior to the survey with the majority 94 of their applications being approved” about 13 applied to financial institutions with 91 of their total financing applications approved while the remaining 9 applied to other sources with a 99 approval rate womenowned firms reported higher demand for financing 33 of womenowned firms applied versus 22 for all respondents but experienced a lower approval rate of 83 overall 94 mainly due to the lack of track record and insufficient documentation “most of these firms obtained unsecured financing from microfinance institutions banking institutions and development financial institutions” bank negara says adding that about 44 of the respondents were firsttime borrowers “the main purposes of the financing applications were for the purchase of assets building property machinery and equipment 23 working capital 22 and starting a new business 19” on average the majority of the applications 89 was approved within one month and the funds were disbursed within the subsequent month says the central bank the survey also provided insights on smes’ usage of other financial services such as insurance takaful and epayments “more than half of the respondents have insurance or takaful products although this was less prevalent among microenterprises  “while the current takeup has been low potential future demand for insurance and takaful by smes is significant for all products across the board with emerging interest particularly in securing protection for risks associated with cyber security professional indemnity payment default and damages in crops” the survey noted that smes mainly made electronic payments but preferred cash in receiving payments from customers “it was also observed that cheques remained popular for payments to suppliers and other business to business transactions” underlying challenges in financing with regards to challenges the survey reveals that financing barriers mainly relate to documentation costs and business viability “among the key constraints to business growth difficulty in accessing sufficient financing was ranked low second to last out of the nine constraints identified by smes” says the central bank it says smes that experienced rejections of their financing applications cited insufficient documentation insufficient cash flow to meet repayments and nonviable business plans as the main reasons for rejection “smes involved in automation innovation manufactures of goods and exports experienced higher rejection rates compared to the overall smes firms that automated stated insufficient collateral and projects perceived to be of higher risk as key reasons for rejection “the rejected applications were mainly for the purchase of machinery and equipment and ict tools as well as undertaking research and development” bank negara says these projects could be deemed to be higher risk as they may involve moveable and intangible assets with low salvage value in the event of commercial failure and involve the use of new and untested processes with high uncertainty on returns “innovative firms cited insufficient documentation as a key factor for rejection exporting and manufacturing firms that faced greater difficulty obtaining financing were mainly firms that were newly established with limited repayment track records “businesses that needed financing but did not apply 41 were either cautious in taking on debt unsure of their repayment capacity or found the application process too difficult” the survey revealed that about 46 of the respondents stated that the financing products offered by financial institutions did not meet their business needs due to high financing costs 50 insufficient financing amount 42 and onerous documentation requirements 29 “the average financing rate that respondents were willing to pay was 388 well below the average lending rates to smes of 618 at the time of the survey second quarter 2018” the survey also indicated that the main constraints to sme growth were factors associated with operating and business conditions namely increasing competition 69 of respondents fluctuating demand 51 rising input costs 44 and rising labour costs 40\r\n",

      "if we were to believe the hype whipped up by some politicians following the formation of the new government the malays in our country are in danger of losing everything planting fear and using race and religion has always been an effective emotional political weapon throw in threats of racial riots and soon the temperature shoots up it doesn’t help when counter arguments come in the form of equally distasteful racist remarks these shenanigans usually only involve a handful of desperate politicians likely the ones who lost in the general election or are being investigated for corruption then there are some very loud cooperatives – presumably paid – who amplify their voices through social media only the ignorant would believe the incredible claims made up by these politicians in malaysia almost all the institutions are dominated by malays including the civil service police army and the government just take a cursory look at the racial makeup of the members of parliament and senators at the dewan rakyat and dewan negara of the country’s 30 millionplus population more than 60 are malays and those numbers will continue to grow while that of the chinese and indians keep shrinking the chinese population in malaysia has consistently been declining from the early days of independence from 376  in 1957 to 246 in 2010 and 214 in 2015 due to a lower birth rate as well as a high level of emigration in recent decades according to a news report in 2016 by 2030 the number of chinese – the second largest ethnic group after the malays – in malaysia will drop to third place after the bumiputra and foreign migrant workers a huge dip in the birth rate of the chinese to 14 babies per family in 2015 from 74 in 1957 and a sharp rise in the numbers of foreign workers are now threatening the chinese’ position as the second largest grouping in malaysia the report quoting projected data from the department of statistics said the population percentage of local ethnic chinese will shrink to 196 in 2030 from 246 in 2010 and 214 in 2015 the chinese percentage is also projected to fall further to 189 in 2035 in the report chief statistician datuk dr hasan abdul rahman said that although the chinese population will increase to 71 million people in 2040 from 66 million now the percentage compared to the malays and indians might decline to 184 in 2040 in terms of numbers the other two ethnic groups are projected to rise with the bumiputra outdoing everyone else the bumiputra population is anticipated to increase from 192 million in 2015 to 26 million by 2040 and indians from two million to 23 million the bumiputra population is anticipated to increase from 618 to 675 and indians from 55 to 64 this huge malay demographic simply means that the malay electorate will be significantly broad looking at the country’s 16 millionstrong civil service bernama reported in 2016 of then minister in the prime minister’s department shahidan kassim saying that as of december 2014 the ethnic composition of the civil service was as follows 788 malays bumiputera sabah 61 bumiputera sarawak 48  chinese 52  indians 41  other bumiputera 03 and others 07 in the case of the powerful police force then home minister datuk seri dr ahmad zahid hamidi said in 2016 that the police needed more nonmalays to enlist as they currently make up only 5 of the 133212strong force “of the total 8023 106871 are malays while chinese make up only 196 2615 indians 316 4209 punjabis 021 275 and others 1444 19242” he told parliament the malaysian army royal malaysian navy and royal malaysian air force are also overwhelmingly populated by malays according to a news report the malaysian army comprises 983 malays and 02 chinese with officers making up 962 out of which 14 are chinese that’s a far cry from the preindependence days when the police especially had a decent number of chinese which was instrumental in our successful thwarting of the communist party of malaya cpm insurgents and urban terrorists it was the infiltration of these chinese policemen into the cpm with the many dangerous and highly classified covert operations of the police special branch and military intelligence which defeated the cpm from the 1960s to the late 1970s nonmalay armed forces personnel comprised about 30 of the total manpower while the navy and air force excluding the army had a higher percentage over the years this figure gradually dropped to the current 5 certainly no one is blaming the government for this situation since it has openly encouraged nonmalays to join the responsibility of defending the country and the people should be shared by all malaysians so it would be terribly unfair if this mammoth burden is only shouldered by the malays however a combination of factors including perceived low chances of promotion has deterred many nonmalays from joining the ranks despite the tiny representation of the nonmalays in the services especially the police the men and women in uniform have performed professionally nonmalays feel secure and protected even in the wake of incidents involving malay attackers and this must be remembered and in the case of the economy despite the large number of chinese businessmen who continue to be listed among malaysia’s richest it has long been acknowledged that the malays are now firmly in control of major banks governmentlinked companies glcs and top posts in the private sector according to prof dr terence gomez the glcs hold sway over some rm1 trillion 333 billion worth of investments according to his research the seven glcs control 35 of the top 100 listed companies in malaysia whose combined market capitalisation accounts for 42 of the market cap of all the listed companies on bursa malaysia many of these companies operate in key sectors of the economy such as utilities infrastructure property and telecommunications for example some of mof inc’s key assets and investments include petroliam nasional bhd khazanah nasional uda holdings bhd keretapi tanah melayu bhd mrt corp sdn bhd syarikat prasarana negara bhd src international sdn bhd as well as several development financial institutions khazanah nasional’s investments include cimb group bhd uem group bhd plus malaysia bhd iskandar investment bhd tenaga nasional bhd axiata group bhd telekom malaysia bhd time dotcom bhd ihh healthcare bhd astro malaysia holdings bhd malaysia airports holdings and malaysia airlines bhd but while these malays on the surface at least seem to be enjoying power and high income from governmentlinked companies many ordinary malays in the rural and urban areas sadly still struggle daily the years of affirmative action have created a broad base of the middle class which is crucial and essential for a stable malaysia but many of the effects have not fully trickled down to the destitute it’s these malays who need help the most and surely they are the most deserving too but wealth has been plundered and looted by corrupt politicians who are now preaching the politics of hatred to their audience cut off from the access of rational and sound arguments in bahasa malaysia the rhetoric of race and religion has found faithful listeners who buy into their bluff of malays being threatened and in danger of losing their rights in the country a privilege belonging to them solely and no other malaysians having a finance minister of chinese ethnicity and an attorney general of indian origin are enough to trigger fears never mind the fact that the government machinery is entirely malay and suddenly icred has taken over 1mdb as the prime issue of the country never mind if their listeners can’t even pronounce the acronym and are largely clueless to what it’s all about but for some reason they seem convinced it takes away malay rights and islam politicians in this country including those in power now are no angels although they would like to be viewed as the new breed of malaysian politicians supposedly blind to race many have used the race and religion card themselves even staging massive protests but are now criticising the opposition for the same thing it’s a classic case of the pot calling the kettle black in some ways some of our new ministers have also failed to handle the civil service well given the crass way they have dealt with the more experienced and knowledgeable senior government officers instead of winning them over – as they too settle into the new political dynamic and culture – some inexperienced ministers with their newfound power and authority ignore their advice malaysia has been drained of copious amounts of money as a result of looting so we really have no time for any hysterics as we need to get back to the economy race and lift our heads high again\r\n",

      "during the ge14 campaign period tun dr mahathir mohamad had famously referred to malaysia’s complex ownership structure of governmentlinked companies glcs as a “monster”  there was irony in this statement because dr mahathir after all had a played a leading role in crea­ting this structure that has enterpri­ses in every sector of the economy however he noted too that this structure was created to serve a “noble vision” but the glcs had evolved into tools exploited by politicians to serve their vested interests  there is undoubtedly a deep sense of frustration among malay­sians particularly business people about the pervasiveness of glcs in the economy  the contention is that the glcs crowd out private firms in key economic segments except the industrial and manufacturing sectors under barisan nasional there had been numerous promises to reform the glcs particularly during economic crises critics also note that the presence of influential politicians in the glcs has weakened managerial practices undermining the performance of these firms  through glcs corrupt politicians have channelled concessions to private companies in exchange for campaign contributions something must be urgently done about the glcs however what is brewing as malaysia embarks on an arduous journey of instituting reforms is a serious divide in opinion about how to deal with these glcs the most commonly articulated panacea is to privatise the glcs unfortunately it is not so simple this debate assumes a homogenisation of glcs when in fact there is a variety of such institutions that play different roles in the economy  how we got here the introduction of the new economic policy nep in 1970 precipitated extensive government intervention in the economy the nep was a progressive 20year affirmative action plan to eradicate poverty and equitably redistribute wealth between ethnic groups bumiputera corporate ownership then stood at a mere 15  government intervention entailed establishing public enterprises to acquire primarily foreignowned businesses these public enterprises later renamed glcs were also introduced at the federal and state levels to play a developmental role in the economy among these glcs were development financial institutions tasked with nurturing domestic smes funding ventures in new sectors and promoting rampd  other glcs included sectoralbased institutions to achieve core development goals and socioeconomictype statutory bodies after dr mahathir was first appointed prime minister in 1981 he embarked on privatisation  par­tly to rid the government of the huge number of glcs but also to create a new breed of bumiputra entrepreneurs who owned business conglomerates of international repute he achieved this goal but the 1997 asian currency crisis unravelled his plans  the government had to renationalise many of these privatised companies creating again a public sector that owned a large number of glcs a plan was initiated to reform glcs mainly those listed on the stock exchange professionals from the private sector were hired to manage them while politicians were removed from their boards of directors these professionals most of whom had never served in government were paid salaries benchmarked against private sector remuneration an issue of much contention today  another criticism was that these executives were subservient to the dictates of the prime minister  one outcome of this reform was that these glcs emerged as leading firms since the turn of the century glcs have been among at least seven of malaysia’s top 10 listed firms glics and listed glcs glcs have however not evolved in a coherently linear direction they are required to fulfil a range of business and social duties implemented by different institutions at the federal level the glcs are primarily owned by five savings and investmentbased institutions the employees provident fund retirement fund inc lembaga tabung haji lembaga tabung angkatan tentera and permodalan nasional bhd sovereign wealth fund khazanah nasional bhd and the government’s primary holding company minister of finance inc collectively termed as governmentlinked investment companies glics these seven vary considerably in size and objectives and are ultimately controlled by the finance minister through a complex pyramidtype organisational structure in early 2017 of the 900odd companies listed on bursa malaysia 70 were glcs that is those with a glic as the largest shareholder the 20 largest among these companies known as the “g20” accounted for about 42 of the exchange’s total market capitalisation what is of concern is that the government has substantial equity interests – ranging from 5 to 37 – in 140 listed firms however the government is not the largest shareholder in these companies instead the majority owners are individuals or foreign enterprises it is unclear why the government has sought to secure such huge shareholdings in these companies that it does not control this sort of equity ownership could well be in order to earn dividends from the companies but such shareholdings can lead to hostile takeovers business owners have long complained of expropriation of their companies by the government ostensibly as part of its equity redistribution exercise fear of expropriation has undermined investor confidence and hampered rampd endeavours to shape globally competitive enterprises reforming the glcs given the scale and scope of government involvement in the malaysian economy urgent reforms are necessary to ensure the glcs function well and are taken out of the overwhelming control of politicians there is no one remedy to deal with this colossal governmentbusiness complex a thoughtful debate is imperative after a comprehensive study of these glcs in the short term institutional reforms can be formulated to ensure accountable and transparent governance of the companies specifically to address concentration of economic power in the finance ministry power has to be devolved to key oversight institutions such as bank negara the securities commission and oppositionled parliamentary committees within glcs autonomous technocratic professionals must be employed based on merit and not ethnicity so that inefficiencies and abuse of power can be curbed these professionals can be appointed by the finance minister who will have jurisdiction over these glcs though subject to parliamentary oversight in the long term as part of the glc reforms there must be a review of how statutory bodies holding companies and foundations function the government should consider the implications of the restructuring on a sectorbysector basis the modes of reforms to be considered include divestment where government presence is not necessary for example in construction media and tourism on the other hand the government would need to retain ownership of glcs in utilities banking oil and gas defence plantations airport services and ports  the transfer of ownership of huge firms in these sectors to private investors may not serve the nation’s interest however in these cases partial privatisation through the listing of the glcs has been proposed as a way to raise funds while extending equity ownership to private investors the government will retain control of these companies while reforms are being debated it must be considered that glcs have played an important developmental role creating a vibrant domestic privatelyowned enterprise base promoting mechanisms to encourage private firms to venture into new economic sectors and enhancing the development of rural and nichebased enterprises glcs must still play this role evidently a number of issues must be reviewed when reforming this interlocking nexus of government and business it is therefore surprising that the reformminded pakatan harapan government has yet to act on this matter even as debates about the glcs

      "kuala lumpur two weeks after the securities commission issued a stern warning to investors putting money into cryptocurrencies bank negara has now said it will be issuing its guidelines on the issue by yearend  bank negara governor tan sri muhammad ibrahim has been looking into the matter and the details as the new form of currency has attracted a lot of attention around the globe “we hope to come out with guidelines on cryptocurrencies before the end of the year in particular those relating to antimoney laundering and terrorist financing we want to ensure that there are clear guidelines for those who want to participate in this sector” he said on the sidelines of the global symposium on development financial institutions the central bank last commented on cryptocurrencies more than three years ago when a statement was issued on jan 2 2014 saying that bitcoin was not recognised as legal tender in malaysia and that it did not regulate the operations of bitcoin “the public is therefore advised to be cautious of the risks associated with the usage of such digital currency” it had earlier said china clamped down on bitcoin recently with news wire reports saying that the secondbiggest economy in the world had seen several large bitcoin exchanges closing down after the government there banned fundraising using the cryptocurrency meanwhile muhammad reiterated that the ringgit should always be reflective of malaysia’s economic strength and fundamentals “what is important is not so much the level of the ringgit but that the ringgit must reflect the economic strength of malaysia if economic growth and inflation are under control then the exchange rates should reflect that” muhammad said he said a company’s competitiveness should not be solely derived from exchange rate weakness and should also be measured on other factors “it is very important that the ringgit reflects our fundamentals we have been very clear to the cooperations that they should not just rely on the exchange rate for competitiveness they should also rely on productivity and innovation to sell to others and cannot just rely on exchange rates when marketing abroad” muhammad said he also said the central bank was monitoring closely inflation levels given the rising local petrol prices “the inflation numbers that we saw in the last monetary policy committee meeting is still within projections inflation numbers are very much dependent on global oil prices and so far we do not expect this to increase at such a rate that would have implications on inflation rate projections not yet” he said “but we are always keeping an open mind as the data comes in we will look at the implications on inflation and we will certainly disseminate this information as it comes in” he added he said that with economic growth being entrenched and inflation sitting within the expected range it gives bank negara a little room for flexibility in terms of policy formation “the next meeting is in early november and we will look at the data again to see where we should position the economy it is very important that our interest rate levels must be at a level that would promote growth and ensure inflation is managed strongly” muhammad said in his speech muhammad said properly structured development institutions could be a potent agent of change for privatesector investment drive growth and forge inclusive societies  he said that more than ever today development financial institutions needed to step up to promote new growth areas  “they should perform a broader role to stimulate economic activity that would not otherwise take place they could also improve the quality and scale of such activities they can provide unique value propositions in terms of advisory and nurturing new growth sectors to become profitable and thus attractive for private investors” he said he highlighted the rise of the korean cultural phenomenon known as the korean wave or “hallyu” now a new growth area for the korean economy with the exports of culture content including films and music at an estimated value of us832bil “this extraordinary rise of the korean wave can be attributed to the growth of investment in the creative industry the industry was boosted by the government’s strategy to prioritise the sector as an engine of growth after the asian financial crisis” he said “the korean government had earmarked 1 of the national budget for development financial institutions to kickstart the sector following their footsteps domestic conglomerates like samsung and daewoo started investing in film financing and video production” muhammad added he said this example showed that development financial institutions were the first to spearhead investments in the film and music industry  “at that time commercial banks did not have the capability to assess the viability of the industry nor accept the intangible assets offered as collateral it was only much later when the industry recorded healthy profits that private investments followed” he said “the success speaks for itself between 2008 and 2011 private domestic and foreign investments in the culture content industry had quadrupled to more than us157mil” he added\r\n",

      "                kuala lumpur malaysias economy expanded at 45 in the fourth quarter of 2016 exceeding  economists survey of 44 underpinned by the manufacturing and services sector bank negara malaysia bnm said  the central bank said on thursday the q4 2016 economic growth as measured by the gross domestic product gdp was flat when compared to a year ago   however for 2016 the gdp grew at a slower pace of 42 when compared with the 5 expansion in 2015  “on a quarteronquarter seasonallyadjusted basis the economy recorded a sustained growth of 14 3q 2016 14” it said  the 45 growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the 42 expansion in 2016 were within the range projected by treasury  bnm said going forward the global economy was expected to improve but remain on a moderate growth path  “while there are indications of more sustained growth in the major economies in 2017 downside risks to global growth continue to prevail arising from the volatility in commodity prices policy uncertainties and growth prospects of the major developed economies heightened risk aversions in the global financial markets as well as geopolitical developments” it said   bnm said while the external environment might continue to remain challenging the malaysian economy will experience sustained growth with the primary driver being domestic demand   “private consumption is anticipated to remain supported by wage and employment growth with additional impetus coming from announced government measures to support disposable income of households   “investment activity will continue to be anchored by the ongoing implementation of infrastructure projects and capital spending in the manufacturing and services sectors” it said  commenting on bnm said the q4 2016 growth was supported by the continued expansion in private sector expenditure   on the supply side growth continued to be driven by the manufacturing and services sectors   “overall domestic demand expanded at a more moderate pace as the improvement in private consumption and investment activity was more than offset by the decline in public expenditure   in the fourth quarter private consumption grew by 62 3q 2016 64 supported by continued wage and employment growth   “private investment registered a growth of 49 3q 2016 47 following continued capital spending in the services and manufacturing sectors growth of public investment improved mainly on account of higher spending on fixed assets by public corporation but nevertheless remained in contraction during the quarter   “public consumption also declined by 42 3q 2016 22 arising from the rationalisation of spending on supplies and services and a moderation in the growth of spending on emoluments   “on the external front net exports contributed positively to growth as real exports expanded at a faster rate than real imports   “on the supply side growth in the manufacturing mining and agriculture sectors improved” bnm said   in the q4 2016 the manufacturing sector expanded at a faster pace at 48 owing to higher growth in both domestic and exportoriented industries   the mining sector recorded an improvement of 49 due to the increase of natural gas production during the quarter   in the agriculture sector economic activity contracted at a slower pace at 24 reflecting the diminishing impact of el niño on crude palm oil yields   growth in the services sector continued to expand at 55 albeit at a more moderate pace supported mainly by consumptionrelated services   in the construction sector growth remained driven by the civil engineering subsector recording a growth of 51  bnm said that in q4 2016 the current account surplus widened due mainly to a higher trade surplus and narrower deficits in the income accounts  the central bank said as at jan 31 2017 the reserves position totalled us95bil rm426bil the international reserves remain ample to facilitate international transactions they are sufficient to finance 86 months of retained imports significantly higher than the 3month international threshold  total gross financing raised by the private sector through the banking system development financial institutions dfis and the capital market amounted to rm3162bil 3q 2016 rm2938bil   on the ringgit bnm said it depreciated by 76 against the us dollar during the quarter   the ringgit also depreciated against the euro 16 the pound sterling 24 and the australian dollar 25 but appreciated against the japanese yen 63   the ringgit also depreciated against all regional currencies with the exception of the korean won by between 21 and 56  bnm said the malaysian financial system remains resilient despite global uncertainties over policy adjustments in the major economies   the domestic banking system remains wellcapitalised with ample liquidity to support the financing needs of businesses and households   as businesses and households continue to adjust to the challenging economic outlook and higher cost of living these financial buffers will support the resilience of the financial institutions   it cautioned that going forward external events will continue to weigh heavily on the volatility of the domestic financial markets   bnm said these include increased uncertainty over political developments and growth in the major economies as well as volatile commodity prices

      "it is on rising trend increasing 14 from three years ago mention corporate fraud and most malaysians will give a blank stare an impromptu survey done by starbizweek in kuala lumpur’s central business district revealed the extent to which people know about corporate fraud of the 25 people 23 did not know or did not want to comment experts say that corporate fraud is on the rise but that is difficult to ascertain since most research depends on survey respondents perhaps the technology to detect such activities is better and the regulators have become more adept but it is for sure that globalisation of economic activities and technology have also played a part in making fraudulent activities harder to detect or prosecute kroll inc the new yorkbased corporate investigations and risk consulting firm says in a report that fraud is on an increasing trend up 14 in its kroll global fraud report 20152016 from three years ago the report noted that threequarters of survey respondents were victims in the past year the report also says that the number of companies weighed down in terms of financial loss arising from fraud has also increased to 69 last year compared with 64 in 2014  an interesting observation among malaysians is the equating of fraud with corruption while its not exactly the same there is often an element of corruption involved as in people being paid off to turn the other way while fraudulent activity is being committed creative accounting is usually what comes to mind among people who have any opinion at all about corporate fraud  vestra solutions managing consultant and certified fraud examiner gerald pillai points out that developing countries such as malaysia can see fraudulent activities rising especially in economically challenging times while baker tilly monteiro heng corporate advisory partner andrew heng pic says corporate fraud is becoming more complex and has become increasingly difficult for auditors to detect  he adds that this is complicated by organisations forming shell companies abroad to create a semblance of legitimate business transactions  “you can create companies overseas and pretend to buy things from you on paper which could look normal until you see the place and there is nothing there  “the level of detection and investigative work definitely will need to be increased which will make it even harder for auditors to detect it will not be something that you can instantly pick from the accounts” heng says obviously any report on corporate fraud in malaysia cannot ignore 1malaysia development bhd 1mdb the controversial governmentowned strategic investment firm on july 20 the us department of justice doj announced a civil suit to seize more than us1bil rm402bil in assets allegedly linked to 1mdb  following the doj action deloitte malaysia 1mdb’s auditor notified 1mdb of its intention to resign deloitte referring to the suit also noted that its audit reports for 1mdb’s financial statements for the financial years ended march 31 2013 fy13 and fy14 can no longer be relied upon because of information in the civil suit that were not available during those periods 1mdb also sent out a statement saying that the audited financial statements for the periods concerned should no longer be relied on in light of the doj suit heng says the 1mdb case is not creative accounting per se but not having the right information on certain assets in certain companies that caused the auditors to withdraw their opinion  referring to the 1mdb case he says the role of auditors have become increasingly tougher and that there is need to give the client the benefit of doubt however in his experience most corporate fraud involving listed companies here will have an element of creative accounting with the intention of manipulating the share price  the transmile group bhd case from 2007 comes to mind this case saw company officials abetting in making misleading statements relating to the airfreight company’s revenue in its unaudited consolidated results for the financial year ended dec 31 2006 heng says there is sometimes an element of moneylaundering involved prominent fraud cases among listed companies in malaysia in recent years include kenmark industrial co m bhd linear corp bhd and axis inc bhd all involving creative accounting in corporate malaysia’s history the bumiputra malaysia finance ltd bmf scandal of 1983 comes to mind as possibly the largest corporate scandal in the country then  the hong kongbased subsidiary of thethen bank bumiputra malaysia bhd provided loans to several shady companies including units of carrian holdings ltd a conglomerate involved in property finance and transportation  it involved the murder of a bank auditor and ultimately saw hong kong’s largest bankcruptcy with the collapse of carrian the government also pumped in billions of ringgit to support bank bumiputra  despite there being a royal commission of inquiry set up for this scandal there were no prosecutions with bmf chairman lorrain esme osman living in exile until his death in london in 2011 gerald says fraud needs to be prosecuted rigorously or it becomes part of the corporate culture this sends a wrong message he asserts given the number of prominent corporate scandals in the country in recent years gerald has this to say “i think of late we have this coverup sort of attitude where we can always fix things and get away with it” it is not to say that nothing is being done where fraud committed by listed companies is concerned the securities commission in its annual report for 2015 shows that 74 of active investigations last year were devoted to insider trading with the remainder for other misconducts such as corporate governance issues fraud and market manipulation  however experts say that there are still weaknesses in the active pursuit and prosecution of corporate fraud cases  they say that the laws are sufficient but enforcement is weak  the statutes that cover fraud and corruption in the country include the malaysian anticorruption commission act 2009 the penal code development financial institutions act 2002 customs act 1967 and the election offences act 1954 “it probably comes down to enforcement whether relevant authorities understand these complications  “there is a corporate crime division in the police force and whether they want to beef up that division is important” says heng  gerald stressed that the relevant authorities need to enforce the law without bias only then can people consciously see that fraud is being taken seriously experts such as heng say if bribery and corruption is lumped in with fraud then the levels of fraud committed in malaysia may be far higher\r\n",

      "there was much concern for the people and investors on how malaysia can weather the storm arising from the continuous plunging crude oil price that hovers around us30 per barrel currently as budget 2016 was drawn up based on estimated oil price of us45 per barrel the pressing question raised is whether our government can deal with the mammoth challenge to source for other revenue streams and to cut the expenditure to sufficiently plug the oil revenue gap so as to stay on course in meeting the fiscal deficit and national debt targets of 31 and 55 limit of gross domestic product gdp respectively failing which the country’s sovereign rating may be downgraded resulting in a whole host of ramifications  it is a relief to know that the government is committed to attaining the fiscal targets set and i am pleasantly surprised this can be achieved largely by the rm9bil cut in the development and operating expenditure  the cut is laudable as the budget’s operating expenditure had already been reduced by rm8bil when budget 2016 was first prepared compared with budget 2015  it is comforting to see greater discipline in public spending in the past the grouses were that only the rakyat were required to tighten their belts  it seems the revenue gap that needed to be filled is not as wide judging from the mere rm9bil cut on public expenditure  this could be due to the unexpectedly high goods and services tax gst collection of rm51bil since its implementation on april 1 2015 the original forecast for the entire 2016 was only rm39bil  we must acknowledge the introduction of gst is absolutely timely to cushion the adversity facing the malaysian economy  the government’s economic transformation programme which also include subsidy rationalisation diversification to the service sector has reduced the country’s dependence on oil revenue from more than 40 of total revenue to 20 currently  it is heartening to note the government did not implement any measures which required the rakyat to fork out more money through income tax and a high in the gst rate doubling the compliance and auditing efforts on tax evaders and restructuring the selling channels in dutyfree islands to plug leakages are continuous actions to ensure unscrupulous businesses are taxed measures that were anticipated but did not materialise included the full withdrawal of labuan duty free status further rollback of tax incentives and hike in stamp duty rate  it is likely that such moves were not implemented as the priority of the government was to maintain a conducive and accommodative business environment to sustain the economy  the government is also providing a special tax relief of rm2000 for individual taxpayers whose monthly salary did not exceed rm8000 which will benefit two million taxpayers and cost the government rm350mil  the 3 reduction for employees’ contribution to the employees provident fund epf will increase market liquidity and purchasing power of consumers the epf cut would add rm8bil in disposable income to the country’s 138 million workforce and if the money is spent as investment or expenditure within our economy it would boost our gdp of rm12 trillion by about 065  the education and tourism sectors will benefit from the additional rm5bil allocation for study loans and the arrival of chinese tourists without visa respectively  smes and startups would also benefit from the rm6bil fund injected by the development financial institutions and governmentowned venture capital funds  other effective measures the government may consider moving forward include optimising the government sizeable workforce which stands at 16mil now  most of the commercial organisations locally and globally are embarking on rightsizing exercises to optimise resources utilisation and enhance competitiveness  ultimately for an economy to thrive the nation’s resources should be fully optimised land disposal can be a major revenue stream in the case of singapore government it reaped about s14bil in 2015 from the sale of land  we may fully adopt the public auction process practised by the singapore and hong kong governments  generally people are encouraged by the better than anticipated state of affairs of our fiscal position as well as the bold measures introduced especially on the rm9bil expenditure cut while more measures can be introduced to further consolidate and stimulate our economy  yee wing peng is the country tax leader of deloitte malaysia the above views are his own\r\n",

      "malaysia restrategises to deal with current economic challenges this is a repeat of what happened to last year’s national budget  with global crude oil prices sliding to new multiyear lows malaysia  which derives a major portion of its revenue from petroleum sources  has been forced to revise its budget 2016 just three months after tabling it in parliament  and similar to what took place around the same time last year policymakers politicians bankers economists business leaders consumer advocates and journalists had congregated at the putrajaya international convention centre picc over the week to listen to prime minister datuk seri najib tun razak’s special address on how the government is going to revise its strategies to weather the current economic challenges faced by the country did the recalibration of budget 2016 meet expectations well going by the reactions of economic stakeholders so far it appeared opinions range from fairly muted to slightly positive alliancedbs research chief economist manokaran mottain for one thinks it is the right move at the right time “the government’s revised macro targets and revision measures look realistic and progrowth” manokaran explains noting that the review of budget 2016 appears targeted at two key macro headwinds facing the country that is depressed crude oil prices that have weighing on the government’s fiscal position and subdued private consumption that could strain economic growth cimb research economist maslynnawati ahmad concurs saying “we view the recent budget recalibration positively as it tries to balance the need to tighten spending and still be able to act countercyclically to prevent a sharper economic slowdown”  “the government realistically assumes a bigger shortfall to incorporate the need for relief measures for rakyat to support growth and did not again for second consecutive year attempt to cut back development expenditure as significantly as it always did in the past whenever faced with an unexpected revenue shortfall or increase in spending” she explains  a banker with a local financial institution on the other hand says “there is no hohum about it we are in a nochoice situation as the economic outlook has become dimmer”  “new targets and assumptions along with fresh stimulus measures have to be set to be more reflective of the present environment importantly we have to be prepared as we will likely see even tougher times ahead” the banker who wants to remain anonymous tell starbizweek on the sidelines after najib’s special address at the picc dimmer outlook indeed there are red flags in the economic horizon  depressed crude oil prices aside we are also looking at potentially slower global economic growth this year while world trade remains sluggish  domestically reports about people facing job cuts and retrenchments in certain industries and businesses experiencing drastic drop in sales are increasing three months ago the government still thought malaysia’s gross domestic product gdp had the potential to grow up to 5 in 2016  but now as highlighted in the recalibrated budget 2016 the government thinks malaysia’s economic growth will unlikely exceed 45 this year  the country’s gdp nevertheless is still expected to expand by at least 4 this year “the best policy strategy now is to focus on growth” manokaran argues applauding the government’s initiatives to spur private consumption which accounts for more than 53 of the country’s gdp under the recalibrated budget 2016 the government has introduced several measures aimed at boosting household disposable income and alleviate the rising cost of living to support private consumption growth  these include allowing employees’ contributions to the employee provident fund to be reduced by 3 from march 2016 to december 2017 granting a tax relief of rm2000 to individual taxpayers earning rm8000 or less a month for the 2015 year of assessment and various initiatives to reduce cost of food and essential goods “the key to support domestic demand is to boost private consumption by putting money into the pockets of consumers” bank negara governor tan sri zeti akhtar aziz explains adding that domestic demand is expected to remain as pillar of growth for malaysia’s economy amid the soft external environment on whether bank negara would cut interest rates to boost the domestic economy zeti says the prevailing overnight policy rate of 325 remains accommodative enough to support growth “what’s more important for the country’s economy now is liquidity and that’s why we have reduced the statutory reserve requirement srr” she explains the srr which is a requirement imposed on commercial banks to ensure that a portion of their funds are placed with the central bank will be reduced from 4 to 35 with effect from feb 1  this measure is expected to inject rm61bil of liquidity into the banking system weak sentiment midf research meanwhile thinks that although some of the new measures under the revised budget 2016 could help cushion the economic slowdown they may not be able to stimulate stronger economic activity due to the critically weak consumer and business sentiment as it is consumer confidence in malaysia has already hit a new low given the poor outlook on the job market and income growth while cost of living continues to increase according to the malaysian institute of economic research mier the consumer sentiment index csi plunged to a record low of 638 points in the fourth quarter of last year  notably the csi has been hovering below the 100point threshold which demarcates between optimism and pessimism since the fourth quarter of 2014  local businesses are also quite pessimistic about the current economic situation  while there is slight improvement in their sentiment business condition index remains in the negative territory at 871 points in the fourth quarter of 2015 analysts point out that there are not many new measures to directly address the needs of the private sector  the only notable one is the rm6bil increase in allocations by development financial institutions and government venture capital funds to benefit startup companies however they reckon that there are already sufficient existing measures to support the private sector  furthermore they note the recalibrated budget 2016 is not a new budget but remains in line with the initiatives and allocation that had been proposed when the original version was unveiled last october fiscal discipline the recalibrated budget 2016 is based on two basecase scenarios one with brent crude which is the international oil benchmark averaging at us30 rm12450 per barrel the other with brent crude averaging at us35 per barrel  this compares with the average oilprice assumption of us48 per barrel used for the original budget 2016 according to secretarygeneral of treasury tan sri mohd irwan serigar abdullah malaysia can withstand sustained oil price decline to us25 per barrel  as long as oil prices remain above that level the country will be able to sustain its economic growth and the recalibrated budget 2016 will remain  but if oil prices were to go any lower than us25 per barrel irwan reckons that there will be great challenges not only for malaysia but also for the global economy brent crude was traded at around us34 per barrel yesterday last week prices of the commodity fell to a 13year low of around us28 per barrel in line with the depressed oil prices the recalibrated budget 2016 projects the government’s revenue to decline by 3542 to rm2163bilrm2179bil compared with the originally estimated rm2257bil while its total spending operating and development expenditure will be cut by 3036 to rm2557bilrm2572bil from the initially proposed rm2652bil “cuts to operating expenditures are positive in the medium term in our view given the relative difficulty in trimming this spending” nomura research says  “we are also not overly concerned by cuts in the development spending budget – as we have argued while malaysia’s public capex disbursement rates are high relative to the rest of the region it is usually less than 100 with an average development spending disbursement rate of 92 between 2011 and 2014” it adds meanwhile manokaran says while the government has been relatively silent on the specific operating and development expenditure it is targeting to slash the commitment to achieve the 31 fiscaldeficittogdp target should augur well for the country’s sovereign rating standings “we believe that the credit rating agencies would be content to see this commitment” he says  looking ahead though manokaran reckons that the fiscal challenge of balancing the budget by 2020 remains  “the government will have to keep future budgets lean as the depressed crude oil price level could remain for a while” he explains\r\n",

      "                kuala lumpur prime minister datuk seri najib tun razak delivered a revised budget 2016 at putrajaya international convention centre  here is the full text of his speech  ladies and gentlemen  i introduction  1 alhamdulillahi rabbil alamin wa bihi nastain blessings and peace be upon prophet muhammad saw  2 i begin by reciting the translation by the ulama with reference to the words of allah taala in surah alinsyirah that with each difficulty surely there is ease or happiness  3 we should place such confidence in ourselves as well as in the administration and management of the government  4 as the old malay saying goes the coast changes with the tide thus i wish to make a special address today as the 2016 budget is also subject to challenges in the global economic environment  5 today i wish to highlight and share with you an explanation comparison and clarification as well as measures undertaken to address various challenges that the nation has and is experiencing for the last two decades  6 we are grateful to allah swt for among those present today are leaders and administrators civil servants captains of industry corporate figures representatives from foreign missions nongovernmental organisations ngos and volunteers  7 all are here today for this special address to understand the governments action in recalibrating and restructuring several economic measures particularly with regard to the 2016 budget  8 of importance the recalibration and restructuring of the budget are centred on two main pillars first to ensure the economy remains on a strong growth trajectory and second to protect and safeguard the welfare and wellbeing of the rakyat  9 in tandem with the people first concept the measures that i will announce soon is a comprehensive summary after taking into account ideas and views that i have received  10 this was complemented by several engagement sessions with various economic stakeholders including governmentlinked companies glcs economists as well as industry experts  11 the government has also received excellent ideas from various levels of ngos representing consumers esteemed businessmen and directors of commercial banks  12 the majority of them are here with us this afternoon thank you for your input  indeed we are all doing this together for our nation  ii comparison of the economic scenario since 19971998  13 first let us reflect on the economic scenario during the asian financial crisis from 1997 to 1998  14 in 19971998 the country experienced an economic recession with gdp recording a negative growth of 74  15 we should not forget that among the significant effects of the recession were the sharp retrenchments increase in inflation reduction in international reserves to rm59 billion and the kuala lumpur stock exchange klse index plummeting to reach 260point level  16 many companies went bust furthermore some of our children including sijil pelajaran malaysia spm school leavers and young graduates had their dreams and aspirations to continue their studies abroad crushed as the government then could not afford to finance them  17 given the situation the leadership of the government then took drastic measures including implementing capital controls and currency pegging the ringgit at 380 to the us dollar  18 banking institutions were rationalised and private sector loans were restructured through the establishment of danaharta and danamodal the government also implemented a stimulus package of rm7 billion to revive the domestic economy  19 the nation again faced an economic recession in 20082009 due to the subprime crisis in the us which impacted the global economy as well as the steep increase in global crude oil prices reaching usd130 per barrel compared with an average of usd70 per barrel in 2007  20 the countrys exports declined by more than 15 this affected consumer and business sentiments  21 during that time i had just been appointed as the minister of finance and without hesitation took immediate measures by announcing the first economic stimulus package amounting to rm7 billion in november 2008  22 a few months later a second stimulus package of rm60 billion was undertaken in march 2009 to continue to stimulate domestic economic activity the second stimulus package also involved initiatives and collaboration between the government and the private sector  23 in addition to the stimulus packages upon assuming the nations leadership and until today the government planned and implemented several initiatives under the national transformation policy ntp  24 the government launched the government transformation programme gtp and the economic transformation programme etp to elevate malaysia to a developed and highincome country by 2020  25 among the achievements of the transformation include strong gdp growth averaging 56 reduction in government fiscal deficit from 67 to 32 as well as manageable inflation rate  26 we are grateful that hardcore poverty has almost been eradicated in addition 18 million job opportunities were created and rakyat 1malaysia initiatives and programmes were introduced such as 1malaysia people assistance bantuan rakyat 1malaysia or br1m 1malaysia book voucher baucar buku 1malaysia or bb1m kedai rakyat 1malaysia kr1m klinik 1malaysia and affordable housing  27 life is not always smooth sailing looking back at the scenario in 2015 malaysia faced several daunting challenges that were unexpected and beyond our control  28 crude oil prices declined from usd100 in 2014 to usd48 per barrel in 2015 crude oil prices have since continued to fall resulting in the recalibration of the 2015 budget  29 last year the countrys oilrelated revenue fell by almost rm14 billion thus on 20 january 2015 on behalf of the government i presented the recalibration of the 2015 budget by rationalising government expenditure as well as revising the fiscal deficit target from 3 to 32 to gdp  30 i would like to emphasise that the recalibration of the 2015 budget was supported by initiatives such as the rationalisation of fuel subsidy which was implemented earlier although it was an unpopular decision  31 all praise is due to allah these measures have been successful in mitigating the impact from declining oil prices and global economic uncertainties  32 indeed international rating agencies such as moodys standard amp poors and fitch remain confident in the nations strong economic fundamentals and financial position by maintaining a good credit rating  33 based on these factors i am confident that the economy will record a growth of 5 and the fiscal deficit at 32 of gdp as targeted for 2015 the gdp growth for 2015 will be announced next month  iii latest economic scenario  34 the global economy is expected to be more challenging in 2016 the latest data by the international monetary fund imf indicates that the global economy will grow at a slower pace from 36 to 34  35 meanwhile world trade is anticipated to moderate from 41 to 34 this is on account of several economies such as south africa the us brazil and china which are also expected to grow at a slower pace  36 this trend proves that we are not alone in facing the global economic challenges other countries too are affected by the current economic uncertainties  37 world crude oil prices have continued to plummet below usd30 per barrel as of yesterday dated brent crude oil prices dropped to usd31 per barrel a reduction of 35 compared to the assumption of usd48 during the tabling of the 2016 budget  38 these developments have a significant effect on the nations revenue the economy of oil producing countries has also been adversely affected  39 furthermore the us dollar continues to strengthen compared to other currencies among the currencies affected are the brazil real 232 china renminbi 57 canadian dollar 113 russian ruble 293 and singapore dollar 56  40 meanwhile the ringgit too has depreciated by 113 against the us dollar from 377 in june 2015 to 425 on 27 january 2016  41 in fact the ringgit is undervalued and does not reflect the true economic fundamentals however the ringgit is expected to better reflect the strength of the economic fundamentals when global financial markets stabilise and oil prices recover to more reasonable levels  iv new measures  42 these developments have increased uncertainties in the global economy and impacted the domestic economy as well as resulted in the rising cost of living of the rakyat  43 recognising this and as a responsible head of the government together with the deputy prime minister and cabinet ministers today we are taking proactive action to announce the implementation of measures under the recalibrated 2016 budget  44 these initiatives are very important to ensure sustainable economic growth and more importantly to safeguard the wellbeing of the rakyat i am confident that together we can overcome these difficult challenges again  we have done it before god willing we can do it again  45 similar to the situation last year i wish to reiterate that the nation is neither in economic nor technical recession  46 in fact with our efforts and prayers the domestic economy continues to remain strong and resilient capable of facing global economic uncertainties  47 in addition to the measures in the 2016 budget i am pleased to announce 11 restructured and recalibrated measures to ensure the economy and financial position remain on the right trajectory  48 measure 1 the government agrees to reduce the employees contribution to the employees provident fund epf by 3 beginning march 2016 to december 2017 however the contribution by employers will remain this measure is expected to increase private consumption expenditure by rm8 billion a year  49 measure 2 the government will provide a special tax relief of rm2000 to individual taxpayers with a monthly income of rm8000 or below for the year of assessment 2015  through this measure although the government will forego revenue of rm350 million it will provide individual tax savings of up to rm475 which will benefit two million taxpayers  50 measure 3 to reduce the cost of daily basic necessities for the rakyat the government will implement the following  i the government will liberalise the control on import quotas or approved permits aps on eight agricultural produce for a temporary period to ensure consistent supply  the produce includes raw coffee beans buffalo meat beef and mutton at the same time quality and safety requirements on imported goods will continue to be given priority  ii federal agricultural marketing authority fama will establish markets or myfarm outlets that sell agricultural produce directly such as fish poultry meat vegetables and fruits at prices between 5 and 20 below market prices for a start the first outlet will be opened in precinct 7 putrajaya in march and expanded nationwide to 10 other locations in town centres this year  iii to ensure that the rakyat enjoy fair prices of goods i have directed the ministry of domestic trade cooperatives and consumerism mdtcc to identify more fair price shops including foreign and local hypermarkets thus fair price shops will be increased from 640 to 1000 shops this year  iv at the same time mdtcc will step up enforcement and take legal action on nonethical businessmen who take the opportunity of profiteering  v to safeguard the paddy farmers as well as to increase paddy production the government will provide an additional cash of rm50 for every metric tonne of cleaned paddy as an input incentive for paddy production at the same time the government will improve the implementation of paddy grading through a standard grading

first after taking into consideration the current economic scenario the government has decided to revise the 2016 forecast of gdp growth to 4 – 45 and the assumption for average dated brent crude oil

to the current environment the government provides a negotiation mechanism through the small debt resolution scheme and the corporate debt restructuring committee under bnm  75 in terms of investment i wish to emphasise that the government remains committed to achieving the targeted private investment totalling rm215 billion this year  76 for example the implementation of major projects such as mass rapid transit mrt and light railway transit lrt panborneo highway malaysian vision valley cyber city centre rapid pengerang and highspeed rail will be continued  77 to enhance strategic linkages

agreements ftas such as the asean economic community aec and the transpacific partnership agreement tppa as well as the upcoming regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep  81 with regard to the tppa which was passed by dewan rakyat late yesterday the allegation by some quarters that we have compromised national sovereignty and were apologetic in defending the bumiputera agenda during the negotiations with tppa members were unfounded  82 it is noteworthy that the governments efforts and firmness during the negotiation process with the members of the tppa have resulted in the acceptance of the bumiputera policy as part of the terms of the agreement at the international level  83 thus the bumiputera agenda is no longer a national agenda but has now been elevated and recognised globally  v conclusion  84 an advanced nation is not solely due to good and appropriate policies but also the contribution from all segments of society  85 we all have a shared responsibility irrespective of the private sector government ngo youth and women and regardless of whether one is a chief executive officer director support staff worker or a small sundry shop owner  86 overall the five key salient points are summarised as follows  first the recalibrated measures announced are proactive transparent and realistic in tandem with the current global economic challenges  second the economy remains resilient and continues to expand driven by domestic economic activity  third the wellbeing of the rakyat will continue to be prioritised and government service delivery will not be compromised  fourth the government is committed to implementing the fiscal consolidation measures and  fifth the recalibration of the budget is centred on the principle of shared responsibility from all segments of society  87 in brief the restructuring and recalibration of the 2016 budget is similar to last year it is not a new budget it is within the range of initiatives and allocation of the 2016 budget approved by parliament  88 it is clear that matters related to the nations economy and finance is not easy to digest and understood by all levels  89 in fact these issues are not solely the responsibility of the nations administration at the highest level  90 borrowing the words of wisdom from the learned ones in life and livelihood in a country with a government everyone must play his part helping each other through thick and thin that is our source of strength  91 hence i hope that every segment plays its part in explaining the current economic situation and initiatives of the government to further strengthen the economy as well as safeguard the wellbeing of the rakyat  92 this means that all groups from the government administration to the learned ones need to explain in greater detail the current situation and challenges to all parties from top to bottom engaging in discussions in mamak stalls over teh tarik to the best of their abilities  93 with that we hope our great grandchildren will recognise all our achievements for malaysias continuity which is not our right but the right of the future generation  94 we hold to the saying of the elders it is better to be silent rather than speak empty words and to give voice to useful matters do not ask what the nation has done for you but ask what we have done for the nation  95 in essence the challenges confronting us currently are not due to the failure of the government to plan but are on account of the global economic crisis which is beyond our control  96 indeed every decision that we make today is the best for the rakyat and will surely be recorded in history furthermore malaysia is neither a failed state nor a bankrupt nation as alleged  97 in fact the reality is the economy is stable with strong growth as well as resilient and competitive  98 let us together pray to the almighty to overcome all problems and enjoy security peace and harmony  thank you\r\n",

rahmanir rahim  assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh dan salam 1 malaysia yab tan sri muhyidin yassin timbalan perdana menteri yb dato’ seri ahmad husni hanadzlah menteri kewangan kedua ybhg tan sri dr ali hamsa ketua setiausaha negara 4   introduction 1 first and foremost let us express our infinite gratitude towards allah swt for with his blessings we are able to gather this morning we also pray for the great prophet muhammad saw 2 we are here this morning with leaders and administrators civil servants industry players and corporate members representatives of embassies ngos and volunteer groups as well as the rakyat in this hall and those watching tv or listening to the speech 3 i would like to address some concerns on the current economic developments and the government’s financial position lately there have been reports concerns and queries on issues such as crude oil prices and performance of the ringgit 4 the government has been vigilantly monitoring the situation in this regard i will announce several proactive measures to realign our policies in line with the changing global economic scenario which is beyond our control we are undertaking this to ensure that we continue to achieve creditable growth 5 in other words i am here today to announce specific and proactive measures to align ourselves with the recent global economic developments 6 we are not in crisis indeed we are taking preemptive measures following the changes in the external global economic landscape which is beyond our control 7 this is to ensure that our economy continues to attain a respectable and reasonable growth and at the same time we want to ensure development for the nation and rakyat continues 8 indeed 2014 was a year of trials and tribulations for us due to several tragedies 9 at the end of last year malaysia was hit by unprecedented floods affecting several states including kelantan terengganu pahang kedah and perak 10 although the floods were not so severe in johor sabah and sarawak local communities in some areas were affected 11 thus it is said that while man plans allah swt plans too and allah swt is the best of the planners 12 the government has always done its best to plan formulate and implement policies and measures for the betterment of the rakyat 13 it has been three months since the 2015 budget was tabled the budget was formulated based on first price of dated brent was forecast at usd100 per barrel 14 second gross domestic product gdp growth estimated between 5 and 6 third a stable exchange rate of rm320 against the us dollar and 15 fourth 2015 world economic growth was projected at 34 and 39 by the world bank and imf respectively since then the world bank and the imf have revised global growth to 3 and 38 respectively 16 it should be noted that budget 2015 was formulated based on strong economic fundamentals in 2014 therefore the fiscal deficit was forecast from 35 in 2014 to 3 of gdp in 2015 17 however the external situation has changed lately and we are impacted directly as malaysia is among the largest trading nations in the world 18 compared to the situation a few months ago the global economic landscape has since changed significantly this necessitates us to review and clarify some of our earlier macro and fiscal assumptions 19 among the issues raised is the government’s ability to achieve its fiscal targets for 2015 given the current situation the question is whether the economy and government’s financial position will be affected 20 in this special address i will explain to the rakyat and announce several measures to mitigate the current economic situation 21 as a responsible government we will continue to ensure economic development and safeguard the wellbeing of the rakyat declining crude oil prices 22 we are aware of the concerns among the rakyat business community and analysts over the impact of the sharp fall in crude oil prices on the domestic economy 23 over the last six months global crude oil prices have plunged more than 50 among others due to oversupply amid weak demand 24 leveraging advances in technology shale oil and gas output has risen significantly in the us 25 the situation is exacerbated by higher output from nonopec organisation of the petroleum exporting countries opec is also not willing to undertake production cuts in order to maintain its market share 26 the government has consistently reiterated that crude oil prices are beyond its control 27 the benchmark dated brent crude oil price has dropped to around usd48 per barrel on 19 january 2015 and analysts expect oil prices to take quite a while to stabilise benefits of declining crude oil prices 28 lower crude oil prices benefit net oil importing countries like malaysia 29 for instance the recent reduction in pump prices of petrol and diesel by 35 sen and 30 sen per litre respectively will increase the overall disposable income of consumers by rm75 billion assuming that consumers spend 40 of this amount it will boost private consumption by rm3 billion 30 the world bank estimates that lower crude oil prices will have a positive impact on world gdp in fact a 30 decline in oil prices could boost global gdp of up to 05 31 this bodes well for malaysia’s manufactured products further with the us economy strengthening there will be sustained demand for our exports in particular electrical and electronics eampe products falling crude oil prices will reduce federal government revenue 32 in contrast falling crude oil prices will reduce government revenue the revenue is used for development purposes such as building of schools roads and houses of worship it is also used for other expenditures such as salaries of civil servants cost of medicine in government hospitals agriculture subsidies and expenditure for security including armed forces police and rela 33 in 2014 dated brent reached its highest level at usd115 per barrel on 19 june global crude oil prices have since plummeted by more than 50 34 consensus among economists is that the forecast price of usd100 per barrel used in the 2015 budget is no longer realistic they now estimate the average oil price in 2015 to range from usd40 to usd70 per barrel 35 the government has therefore revised downwards its forecast for the average baseline oil price to usd55 per barrel for 2015 36 based on the crude oil price of usd100 per barrel coupled with savings following the implementation of the managed float pricing mechanism for retail fuel prices effective from december 2014 the government is expected to get an additional operating surplus of rm37 billion 37 if crude oil price remains at usd100 per barrel the government will be able to accommodate all the measures announced in budget 2015 with the fiscal deficit target not exceeding 3 of gdp 38 however at the forecast price of usd55 per barrel there will be a revenue shortfall of rm138 billion 39 if we compare the revised figures with budget 2015 tabled in october last year despite the savings of rm107 billion from the implementation of the managed float mechanism for retail fuel prices the government still faces a revenue shortfall of rm83 billion to accommodate the 2015 budget measures 40 without any fiscal measures the deficit will increase to 39 of gdp against the target of 3 for 2015 41 this requires the government to take measures to reduce the deficit in line with the government’s commitment towards fiscal consolidation 42 therefore taking into account the revised estimates we are revising the fiscal deficit target to 32 of gdp in 2015 43 this is still lower than the fiscal deficit of 35 of gdp in 2014 in view of the external factors we have to acknowledge that we may not be able to achieve the earlier fiscal target of 3 of gdp as announced of importance is our commitment to continue reducing the fiscal deficit from 35 of gdp 44 more importantly we will not compromise on national development planning as it will enhance productive capacity of the economy we will not neglect the rakyat’s welfare particularly the bottom 40 of households volatile capital flows and ringgit 45 the fluctuations in the ringgit are influenced by developments in the global economy hence the ringgit is not the only currency to have weakened against the us dollar in fact almost all currencies in the region have softened against the us dollar since september 2014 46 the recent volatile capital flows and significant depreciation of the ringgit were also due to concerns over the impact of the sharp fall in oil prices on the malaysian economy 47 in relation to this we must closely monitor the following first the current account in the balance of payments must remain in surplus second continue with fiscal reforms and consolidation and third economic activity must be further diversified to enable us to cope with falling crude oil and commodity prices 48 the government is confident that the exchange rate will over time adjust to reflect the strong economic fundamentals of importance our financial system continues to function in an orderly manner 49 most importantly there has been no disruption to financial intermediation with lending activities continuing smoothly businesses continue to have access to financing from banking institutions and the capital market 50 in essence greater policy flexibility adequate international reserves deeper and more diversified financial markets sound banking system and strong domestic institutional investors such as the employees provident fund will increase resilience to volatile capital flows current account balance 51 the current account balance is directly related to the import and export of goods and services 52 we are a crude oil exporter thus when oil prices plummeted recently there was a perception that export receipts will also decline drastically and result in a current account deficit 53 indeed this perception is not correct as a net crude oil exporter we had a surplus of rm77bil from january to november 2014 54 however we are an importer of petroleum products with a net import bill of rm89bil during the same period 55 if we include both crude oil and petroleum products we are actually a net importer with a deficit of rm12bil 56 therefore the perception that malaysia is a large oil producer is also not true 57 however if we factor in exports and imports of crude oil and nett out petroleum products then malaysia is a net importer of petroleum this does not include lng for which malaysia is a net exporter 58 furthermore we are still resilient as our diversified economy is able to weather the decline in oil prices 59 with a better outlook for the global economy in 2015 the shortfall in commodity receipts is expected to be cushioned by increased demand for manufactured goods such as electrical and electronic products woodbased products textile products and others which account for 76 of total exports meanwhile crude oil exports account for only 45 of total exports 60 therefore the government is confident that the current account will remain in surplus this year although smaller in the range of 2 to 3 of gross national income or gni in 2014 the current account balance is estimated to record a surplus at 51 of gni strategies to strengthen economic resilience 61 as i have explained earlier there are several issues which will impact the domestic economy significantly in the light of this the government will take measures to ensure economic growth remains on a strong trajectory we are confident of achieving gdp growth in the range of 45  55 this year with the implementation of the following strategies  first ensure balanced inclusive and sustainable economic growth  second continue fiscal reforms and consolidation and  third provide assistance to the rakyat and business community to rebuild infrastructure damaged by floods 62 first strategy ensuring balanced inclusive and sustainable economic growth to boost exports of goods and services the following measures will be taken first actively promote importsubstitution services such as shipping port education and professional services

fiscal reforms and consolidation among the revenue enhancement measures include first broaden the tax base by encouraging companies to register with the royal malaysian customs to enable them to charge and collect gst this is expected to contribute an additional rm1 billion in gst collection as at midjanuary 2015 more than 304000 companies have registered and second realise additional dividends from glcs and glics as well as other government entities amounting to rm400mil the government will undertake the following expenditure rationalisation measures first optimise outlays on supplies and services especially overseas travel events and functions and use of professional services this will result in savings of rm16bil second defer the 2015 program latihan khidmat negara to

      "  petaling jaya a move to restructure the government’s housing loan division will shave the fiscal debt and possibly raise housing loan growth by commercial banks analysts are expecting the government to transfer rm42bils worth of civil servant housing loans into the banking system whereby staff will pay the normal 4 per annum and the government will subsidise any interest above that threshold all commercial banks are also expected to be eligible to participate in providing housing loans for government servants and analysts expect the transfer of loans to commercial banks and development financial institutions will lower total federal government debt by around 4 to 45 from 518 of gdp as of june 30 2013  the idea to restructure the government’s housing loan division was first mentioned in last year’s budget as part of efforts to consolidate the fiscal deficit and to ease the government’s financial burden during the budget speech it was mentioned that the government would appoint panels from commercial banks to manage new housing loans effective january 2013  but this had yet to implemented said a local research house  the research house reckoned the staff housing loans would be transferred to governmentowned development financial institutions such as bank rakyat bank simpanan nasional agro bank and bank pembangunan which will manage and administer the existing stock and future stream of civil service home loans  another a local bankbacked brokerage analyst said whether it made sense or not for banks to be allowed to handle government staff housing loans would much depend on the profitability of such loans “banks should take into account whether in the long term it is profitable to do so after weighing in various factors such as its capital consideration and interest rate environment among others’’ he told starbiz he said the treasury housing loans charged a flat rate of 4 compared with between 42 and 43 for new home loans by commercial banks and it would all depend on whether banks make a profit after taking into consideration the above factors over the long term an industry observer said the move could uplift loan growth in the banking system coupled with other positive factors if some of the rm42bil were to be transferred to commercial banks  another bankbacked analyst said the transfer could be positive for the banking system as the recent measures to shorten the tenure for mortgage and personal loans as well as the potential fiscal tightening by the federal government via subsidy rationalisation programme in the later part of the year could dampen loan growth momentum in the retail segments this move to transfer could to an extent boost loan growth in the banking system moving forward total banking system loan growth to date stands at rm117tril some analysts are however maintaining their loan growth projections this year  on a yeartodate annualised basis the banking system’s outstanding loans growth was relatively flattish at 98 in august property loans remained the key driver where loans for the purchase of residential and nonresidential properties accounted for 56 of credit growth  this is followed by working capital and hire purchase loans contributing 152 and 11 of credit growth respectively lending indicators for august gained momentum yearonyear but fell on a monthonmonth basis   loan applications approvals and disbursements dropped by 99 81 and 24 monthonmonth to rm675bil july 2013 rm75bil rm335bil july 2013 rm365bil and rm801bil july 2013 rm821bil respectively\r\n",

      "this is turning out to be generally an interesting time for malaysia building society bhd mbsb following the enforcement of financial services act 2013 fsa the nonbank financial provider next course of action will be closelywatched by investors and the industry   under the previous banking and financial institution act 1989 bafia mbsb is defined as a scheduled institution the status of an exempt finance company was granted to mbsb on march 1 1972 by the finance ministry and the status has remained since and is thus not bounded by any financial regulators in malaysia the status allows mbsb to undertake a financing business in the absence of a banking license   analysts say under the new legislation the finance ministry could designate financial intermediaries not under the supervision of central bank as a prescribed financial institution if such intermediaries are deemed to pose a risk to financial stability thus it will be interesting to see what will this mean for mbsb   alliance research analyst cheah king yoong says under section 212 of the fsa bank negara is authorised to supervise entities previously not under its charge   “bank negara is authorised to supervise financial entities previously not under the supervision of the central bank but are now deemed to pose a systemic risk to the overall financial stability by the finance ministry this could impact the relatively large nonbanking entities currently not under supervision of bank negara such as mbsb” he says   in addition maybank investment bank research analyst desmond ch’ng says technically this could bring mbsb and the development financial institutions dfis under bnm’s purview but only if they pose a risk to financial stability  “assuming mbsb is designated as a prescribed financial institution the nearterm impact could be negative from a reclassification of its nonperforming loan npl on a 3month rather than 6month basis which could raise npl levels and the need to shore up capital  “secondly mbsb would likely have to raise equity capital much sooner than expected to bolster its capital base its tier 1 capital ratio was 66 endsep 2012” ch’ng says      click on image for larger view   reclassifying mbsb’s npls from six months to a threemonth basis is necessary to enable mbsb to evaluate the progress of its transformation visàvis the commercial banks under bank negara’s purview  a local bankbacked analyst says that presently it remains “status quo” for mbsb unless it is deemed as posing a systemic risk to the financial stability “mbsb is not governed under the now repealed bafia and its books are not audited the caveat for mbsb to come under the central bank’s charge is if it is deemed risky”  he adds that the fsa opens up an opportunity for bank negara to look at its books as they don’t have any restriction from doing that for now   analysts say the concern on mbsb is its burgeoning portfolio of personal loans to civil servants   started in 1950 as the federal and colonial building society ltd the loan portfolio for mbsb has grown significantly from just providing mortgages its biggest earnings contributor now is made up of personal loans to civil servants and it has since expanded into financing retail businesses corporate outfits wholesale banking and treasury products  as at dec 31 2012 fy12 mbsb’s total loans rose to rm243bil with the bulk of it coming from personal loans   mbsb’s personal financingi pfi has grown tremendously in the past five years in 2009 its pfi accounted for just about 116 of its gross loans and this has swelled to 663 in 2012 concurrently its mortgage which formed the bulk of its gross loans in 2009 accounting for 479 has reduced to 185 in the first quarter its auto loans are gaining traction especially since the company tied up with the naza group  in addition mbsb has also been reducing its total net npl ratios over the years to 45 in fy12 from a high of 1954 in 2009 mbsb’s deposit growth has also registered a significant growth in fy12 its deposit rose to rm215bil in fy12 from rm76bil in fy09   in the first quarter ended march 31 2013 mbsb saw its net loans and financing grew more than 50 to rm266bil from rm176bil in the first quarter in 2012 it reported a net profit of rm16614mil or 1308 sen per share in the first quarter ended march 31 compared with rm7941mil or 653 sen per share a year ago underpinned by its islamic banking operations and lower impairment losses  mbsb’s pretax profit surged 1146 to rm23711mil from rm11047mil while revenue rose 484 to rm56247mil from rm37888mil  for 2013 mbsb aims to bring its loantodeposit ratio down to 95 while a 20 target has been set for loan and deposit growth  nevertheless mbsb is already working towards complying with bank

structure to prepare to comply with the fsa   president and chief executive officer datuk ahmad zaini othman says mbsb must first practise and perform like a bank before its application can be

      "finally the audit oversight board aob has imposed its first sanction on july 12 more than two years after it had been set up the board reprimanded alvin tee guan pian the senior partner of accounting firm uhy malaysiathe aob only provided a brief description of the breach “failure to comply with the relevant requirements of the recognised auditing standards in malaysia ie the international standards on auditing”tee was penalised because he was the engagement partner in the audit of a public interest entity pie for the financial year ended july 31 2010 it appears that the breach had to do with the way the audit was conductedapart from listed companies pies include banking and financial institutions including islamic banks and development financial institutions insurance companies and takaful operators and holders of capital market services licences such as securities and futures trading firms and fund management companiesthe aobs refusal to reveal more about why tee deserved a reprimand invites us to play the guessing game which of the many international standards on auditing applies in this case and in what way exactly did tee fail to comply with the auditing standard or standards why did this merit a sanctionit was uhy that threw some light on this matter through a press release it issued on july 16 in response to a starbiz report on the reprimandthe firms explanation is that there is a clash of opinions on whether it was right to believe that the pie was a going concern back when its 2010 accounts were auditedsaid the press release “uhy elaborated that the particular pie was merely undergoing a recapitalisation exercise where the focus on uhys decision to concur with its clients going concern assumption has been an area that the aob differs in terms of its technical view of the matter uhy believes it has strong grounds to appeal the aob decision as the differing views are judgemental in nature”a fundamental principle in the preparation of financial statements the going concern assumption simply means that the management of an organisation has no reason to believe that the organisations operations will come to a halt in the foreseeable futurewhen doing an audit the auditor has to decide whether the use of the going concern assumption is appropriatethe aob has not responded to the uhy statement although when speaking to starbiz earlier aob executive chairman nik mohamed hasyudeen yusoff took pains to point out that the reprimand didnt mean that the pies 2010 accounts didnt give a true and fair view of the pies financial position and performanceinstead he added the reprimand was because the auditor failed to do what was necessary in performing the auditbut what was it that wasnt done we wont know until the aob and uhy decide to say moremeanwhile its useful to look at the aobs annual reports for 2010 and 2011 which talk about issues concerning the going concern assumption that were uncovered when the board reviewed the audit work of some firmsin 2010 the aob highlighted several weaknesses in this area such as auditors not doing enough to assess the appropriateness of the going concern assumption although there were signs of going concern issues lack of evidence that the auditors had challenged key assumptions used by management to support the basis for going concern and a majority of auditors failing to perform an independent stress test or sensitivity analysisthe board then became specific “in three instances there were disclosures in the financial statements or managements representation letter which point to significant doubt or dependence of a future event to support their ability to continue operating as going concern entities however the audit opinion did not reflect the substance of such disclosures“in another instance while an emphasis of matter opinion relating to going concern was issued the description of the facts supporting the opinion gave a different connotation as though there was no default in debt obligationssome of these issues observed in the 2010 inspections persisted the following year judging from the comments in the aobs annual report 2011“the aob reiterates the need for assessing the fundamental assumptions of going concern made by management in the preparation of financial statements audit firms need to improve in this area as our inspection revealed that the performance of audit procedures is generally lacking” said the board in the latest annual report“it is important to acknowledge that going concern considerations involve risks of key judgment area especially when the managements assessment may not be realistic”clearly this is an area that calls for professional scepticism something that auditors are expected to exercise in spades in the course of their workthere is no easy way to determine how sceptical an auditor should be in assessing the appropriateness of the use of the going concern assumption but the aob reprimand last week suggests that an intimate knowledge of the international standards on auditing is always desirablegt executive editor errol oh was told that professional scepticism is in short supply but he doesnt believe it  \r\n",

      "petaling jaya the audit oversight board aob has flexed its regulatory muscles in a surprising way when it shortened the tenure of registration for three partners of two accounting firms from the usual one year to six months although by no means the harshest action that the board can take this reduction of the validity period of registration serves notice that the work of auditors of large companies is indeed under greater scrutiny than beforethis measure came after the boards inspection last year of the countrys six biggest audit firms  pricewaterhousecoopers kpmg ernst amp young deloitte bdo and crowe horwath two of the three partners are from crowe horwath while the third is from ernst amp young they were registered for six months instead of 12 because the aob found certain shortcomings while reviewing the audit jobs in which the trio were involved as engagement partnersan audit engagement partner is the person responsible for the performance of an audit and for the audit report issued after the work is donethe rationale for the shorter registration tenure for the three individual auditors is so that they will go through an earlier reevaluation than the rest to determine if there are improvements in the audits under their watchunder the section 31s of the securities commission act 1993 the period of registration with the aob or the renewal is for 12 months but the board has the discretion to specify otherwiseaob executive chairman nik mohd hasyudeen yusoff said the decision to halve the registration period for the auditors was based on its observations during the inspections of their firms last yearhe added “we feel that we need to send a signal that the auditors must improve themselves we want the firms to be very serious about maintaining audit quality we shortened the registration period because we are timing the next inspections to happen before the respective sixmonth period is up we will look at their job performance and if they have improved we will put them back on the normal arrangements”on why the aob focused on the partners instead of their firms he explained that the boards inspections showed that the firms had put in place the required process and controls “the other part is when the individual auditors perform their work as engagement partners they take responsibility from our viewpoint and after deliberation at the board level this is the right measure to take in these particular situations based on the facts of these cases if we had felt that the issues were more of a systemic nature we would have looked at the firms” he saidhe pointed out that shortcomings identified in the inspections related to noncompliance with some aspects of the international auditing standards in the performance of the relevant audits but these did not invalidate the audit opinions expressed on the financial statementscrowe horwath malaysia managing partner poon yew hoe said the firm had 20 partners the registration of all of them were renewed accordingly except for the two whose registration were renewed for six months“we are not aware of any specific reasons for the sixmonth renewal and will be working closely with the aob to ensure all our partners remain registered with the board at all times as integrity remains one of our core values crowe horwath is committed to observing and adopting the highest level of auditing and ethical standards” he addedin a statement issued to starbizweek ernst amp young said it welcomed the findings and comments in the aobs inaugural annual report released on march 31 added the firm “the aob has acknowledged that the audit firms inspected had put in place systems and procedures in line with global best practices however there are some specific areas for improvement”however the firm declined to comment on the sixmonth renewal of its partners registration pending clarification from the aobthe aob commenced operations on april 1 last year and immediately began registering audit firms and individual auditors at the yearend 83 firms and 310 individual auditors were on the boards register of auditorsthe six firms covered in last years inspections were chosen because they collectively audited 73 of the public interest entities pies in malaysia while their listed clients accounted for 93 of the total market capitalisation of the companies on bursa malaysia pies include listed companies banking and financial institutions including islamic banks and development financial institutions insurance companies and takaful operators and holders of capital market services licences such as securities and futures trading firms and fund management companiesthis year the aob plans to inspect the six largest firms again plus 12 others\r\n",

three the resulting combinations will be keenly watched   mampa scenariosthe hottest deal now is the sale of the 25 stake held by the abu dhabi commercial bank adcb in rhb capital bhd so far three to four parties have submitted their bids for the stake for which the asking price is said to be around two times book value or rm10 per shareat rhb the talk on mampa revolves around two elements  sale of the adcb stake and even rhb itselfspeculation on a possible rhbcimb merger has resurfaced it was first mentioned as part of a game plan when cimb took over southern bank bhd and rhb was seen as the next potential takeover target for cimbthe rumours on a possible rhbcimb merger were stoked following a recent statement by cimb chief datuk seri nazir razak on its ambition to be among the top three in asia in terms of market capitalisationno doubt there will be duplication in the investment and corporate banking business but that is seen to be the fastest route to the top among malaysian banks in terms of market capitalisationsome analysts consider cimb to be strong enough to do another merger following its merger with southern bank five to six years agothe employees provident fund epf

big banks may be less nimble and innovative in extreme cases their formation may lead to cartelisation to the detriment of consumershowever that tendency could be limited as banks compete heavily against each other an analyst points out while in the area of mortgage loans the rates are getting cheaper it is noted that rates for credit cards stay consistently high among all the banksanalysts caution against systemic risk if the largest banks merge to form banks that can be deemed “too big to fail”“in the us that threshold is 10 of loans however  in the malaysian context there is already a high concentration of assets in the largest banks in malaysia says an analysthowever in the consolidation process bank negara would be in a position to decide which mergers are in the best interest of

competition banks are likely to come up with more products to earn more money thus giving better choices to consumers“if the partner and chemistry are right the mampa can work says an analyst pointing to the two major ones that have worked  cimb and southern bank in the retail space the tieup between ammb with anz has resulted in profitabilityin some instances for example the card business the

consolidation will be driven by those with strong capital base strong shareholders and the need to expand regionallythe management should not be restricted to just local talent “we need the best azlan says “we should not be too restrictive but look into hiring foreignersaccording to  jegarasasingam there is considerable fragmentation of market share among the smaller banks with the three large local banks accounting for nearly 4045 of assets in the malaysian banking sectorthe three small local banks including eon bank which has since been acquired by hong leong bank account for only 78 of banking sector assetsconsolidation of hong leong and eon bank will enable both groups to reach out to a larger customer base and most segments with a broader range of products services and solutions to reach out to over 300 branches and 1200 selfservice terminals“with the combined hong leongeon bank we reassert our strong position in the retail segment for the business segment we have doubled up

tells starbizweekthe customer will also benefit as evolving market trends that include mass adoption of portable devices mobile interaction and social networks point to the need to offer more relevant integrated and seamless solutions and offerings   not a shrinking pieconsolidation usually refers to shrinkage and while the local pie is shrinking via this consolidation process licences are issued to a host of global commercial and islamic banks from overseasaccording to chia these moves to consolidate and at the same time expand certain niches are specifically targeted“there are new segments that are underserved and a need to cater for the changes arising from asean integration as well as the rise of india and china as more important trading partnersin the investment banking space the expansion from universal broker status has led to the creation of six nonbank backed investment banks alongside the existing nine bankbacked armsaccording to u chen hock ceo of osk investment bank finding its own niche and achieving scale through regional operations is a primary way to sustain this new growth areathe setting up of new islamic banks also represented another dynamic growth area

outside malaysia to tap the asean growth and integration“regional and crossborder investment trade foreign exchange and wealth flows will further accelerate the regionalisation imperative says chiaexpansion in the banking sector is also via the eequation of mobile and online banking“the next generation of consumers expect easier and faster access to financial information with many expecting 24 7 ubiquitous access“providing digital age offerings will come under the spotlight and will redefine customer engagement and relationship management for the banking industry says chia of hong leongdatuk seri abdul wahid omar president and ceo of maybank does not see these two trends  consolidation and expansion  as contradictory“the need for the banking industry to expand will be there as long as consumer and business demand grow to expand the economy and in turn it is the banking sector that also drives the economy he saysas malaysia becomes a developed economy it is the larger banks with their economies of scale and scope that will have the ability to provide a wider range of products and services at a lower cost“for this to happen the industry will have to go through a consolidation phase where banks will grow not just organically but through acquisition of smaller banks says wahidthe major issue is ensuring that the right banks are merged there must be a business fit that complements each other with as little duplication as possible reducing this duplication will take time given that retrenchments or relocation of employees could have regulatory restrictions as seen in the previous consolidation of 19992002 where banks were not allowed to retrench staff for two years following a merger“experience has shown that banks can often see a decline in productivity upon a merger and in practice mergers can take two to three years before they become value accretive depending also on the valuation of the acquisition“in the interim if investors see greater value elsewhere the resulting depressed share price could have negative implications for example in raising capital says an analystanother issue for smaller banks in attracting foreign banks to become a strategic partner is that the limit on foreign shareholding could be a hindrance although this could be resolved on a case by case basis as indicated by bank negarajegarasasingam of marc cautions against small malaysian banks from expanding into regional markets which are generally risky and complex to managein consolidation exercises heavy competition among potential acquirers may at times result in a substandard due diligence exercise arising from the eagerness to close the deal ahead of competitors he says”any merger or acquisition should not merely be driven by attractive pricing such deals should also be evaluated in terms of the potential value proposition and the effort required for extracting results out of the deal he adds   future directionwith so many measures taken to boost islamic banking repositioning the banking system in the competitive global arena as the international islamic financial centre has become a priority says promodhe also expects some relaxation of foreign equity ownership in domestic banks removal of some existing restrictions on locally incorporated foreign banks and the issuances of more licences that will encourage competitioncurrently commercial and investment banking businesses are held under different legal entities in a universal banking group he notes“there may be more flexibility to remove these regulatory walls in search of administrative efficiency“bank negaras next financial sector blueprint might also create regulatory and market undercurrents to consolidate the role of financial cooperatives and development financial institutions an area which was not prioritised in the last financial sector master plan he sayspromod does not discount the possibility of a shakeout in the standalone investment banking space“there clearly has emerged a huge gap in franchise between the large investment banking powerhouses that are part of universal banking groups and their much smaller standalone rivals“this

      "a lot is riding on the sturdiness of the audit oversight board frameworkwhose fault is it if the quality and reliability of audited financial statements in malaysia suffer because the audit fees dont correspond to the amount and nature of work required to do a good job this mismatch is a common complaint among the auditors we often hear them lamenting that the fees in malaysia are on the low side for an example of this read our up close amp personal interview with kpmg malaysia managing partner mohamed raslan abdul rahman on page 6the maiden annual report of the audit oversight board aob issued on thursday has amplified the issue when highlighting the key findings from its inspections of the six largest audit firms in the country the board points out that auditors need to price their services at levels that will ensure that they can comply with the requirements of auditing and ethical standards the worry here is that firms may decide on the resources to be deployed for audit engagements based on the fees they will earn rather than on the risks that need to be addressed when auditing the accountsin its annual report the aob relays the grouse of audit firms that “due to the relatively low audit fees in malaysia it is a big challenge for them to secure adequate resources” considering that the aob was set up to assist the securities commission in regulating auditors of public interest entities pies its telling that the board saw this matter as worthy of a mention but does this mean that the authorities agree that the auditors are not being paid enough for their servicesif youre bent on getting an unambiguous answer to that good luck to you the board will only go as far as to emphasise that the fees should be properly tied to the audit work that ought to be done it says in the annual report “the aob is mindful that the global economy is still in a recovery stage this will continue to place pressure on pies to contain their operating costs including audit fees nevertheless the aob expects auditors to price their fees to commensurate with the risks undertaken so as not to compromise on audit quality”pies include listed companies banking and financial institutions including islamic banks and development financial institutions insurance companies and takaful operators and holders of capital market services licences such as securities and futures trading firms and fund management companieswhen fielding questions from reporters after releasing the report aob executive chairman mohamed nik hasyudeen yusoff stopped short of endorsing the view that companies in malaysia should get used to the idea of paying higher audit fees he said the board would not tell the firms what to charge clients and would leave this to the market forces to decide instead he urged companies to look at audit fees as an investment rather than as a cost because the work of auditors supports the enhancement of a companys valueto help audit firms in determining fees the malaysian institute of accountants have something called a guide to charging for professional assurance services it says “fee arrangement is a matter for commercial negotiation by practitioners the institute does not prescribe the mandatory basis for calculating fees nor does it ordinarily investigate complaints relating solely to the quantum of fees charged“the level of fee is to be mutually agreed between the auditor and his client which largely depends upon the skill and knowledge required level of training and experience of the staff involved the time necessarily occupied and the degree of responsibility and urgency of work involved“however this rpg recommended practice guide is useful as a benchmark to establish the reasonable level of remuneration commensurate with the provision of professional services of an acceptable and recognised standard in the absence of other more sophisticated billing methodology”the problem is not many firms make full use of the rpg hence we continue to hear the auditors grumbling about the fees perhaps their best hope is that the aob framework will bring about desirable changesthe strategy here is that the aob inspections will compel the firms to improve their compliance with the standards and consequently the firms will turn to their clients and say “look well get into trouble with the regulators if our audit work falls short of the requirements of the standards we wont cut corners and we wont reduce the scope of the work our fees have to be rightsized if you dont want to pay that much find auditors who are willing to risk being slapped with sanctions by the aob”of course such a transition in mindset will take time meanwhile lets see how the aob handles the errant firms that has no qualms about bending the rules to fit the fees the annual report has this to say “it has been a known area of concern that the provision of nonaudit services by audit firms to their listed audit clients may result in auditors lowballing their audit fees to gain more consulting jobs at clients and this may compromise independence the aob will be reviewing the safeguards in place to understand how the threats are mitigated” again who should we blame for lowquality audits deputy executive editor errol oh believes that many people dont understand what is it that auditors really do\r\n",

      "kuala lumpur the audit oversight board aob has pinpointed “a number of shortcomings” after inspecting the countrys six largest audit firms last year this raises the possibility of the board finding more areas of concern when it widens its inspection coverage to include smaller firms this yearaob executive chairman nik mohd hasyudeen yusoff said the board was targeting to inspect 18 audit firms this year including midtier and small firms “we will have a better picture of where everybody is in the financial reporting ecosystem” he told reporters after the release of the aobs maiden annual report yesterdayhe described the inspections and the resulting remediation as the most important part of the boards work “this is where we try to influence the quality of audit when we understand where the firms are lacking and where they can improve” he saidlast year the aob used a riskbased approach to select the six firms for inspection these firms are the big four pricewaterhousecoopers kpmg ernst amp young and deloitte and two others with more than 10 partners the board did not name the latter but according to its register of auditors bdo and crowe horwath are the only firms apart from the big four that have more than 10 partnersnik mohd hasyudeen said these firms collectively audited 73 of the public interest entities pies in malaysia while their listed clients accounted for 93 of the total market capitalisation of the companies on bursa malaysia pies include listed companies banking and financial institutions including islamic banks and development financial institutions insurance companies and takaful operators and holders of capital market services licences such as securities and futures trading firms and fund management companiessaid nik mohd hasyudeen “we have decided that the six firms will continue be inspected annually because of the impact of their work whereas the others will each be inspected every three years but that depends on what we find during the inspections because we may have to conduct followup inspections”in his message in the annual report he wrote “while we determined that the audit firms inspected had put in place systems and processes in line with global best practices some specific areas for improvements were identified the aob will follow up on the remediation efforts of the audit firms to ensure substantive changes are effected to enhance audit quality”the report said the inspections had identified a number of shortcomings that needed to be addressed by the firms particularly in the area of audit documentation and evidence for significant judgement areas“if a firm doesnt document its work there is no basis for us to confirm that the firm has performed its function one of the principles that we have adopted in our inspections is that if you fail to document we will consider that you have not done the audit procedure this is a very strong position that we have taken” added nik mohd hasyudeensaid the aob in the annual report “other than instances where there was insufficient documentation for the audit evidence obtained there were instances where the necessary audit procedures and evidence were clearly not performed or obtained it is pertinent to recognise that without sufficient evidence and analysis the auditor may not have a basis to support their opinion”the board also called on the auditors to be more robust and to apply professional scepticism in challenging management assumptions and estimates particularly in areas that require significant professional judgement such as in determining fair value asset impairment and going concernhe said these were highly subjective areas and pointed out that the value of the audit work came from the auditors exercising professional scepticism to objectively and independently arrive at audit opinionsanother key observation by the aob following last years inspections was the need for audit firms to price their services at levels that commensurated with the risks undertaken so as not to compromise on audit qualitythe annual report also highlighted that human resource was an important factor in ensuring high quality audit including ensuring appropriate workload of partners and other members of the audit team as well as attracting new talent through a conducive work environmentnik mohd hasyudeen said the board had yet to determine if the issues uncovered in last years inspection would lead to inquiries and possible sanctions he explained “our main focus is to work with the firms on remediation that is very critical if we have identified areas for improvement we need to get that resolved immediately rather than to prolong the situation given that we just completed the inspections in december we are still looking at a number of issues if we were to impose sanctions we will be transparent”\r\n",

      "the buildup of household debt has been a topic that has generated much discussion in recent months and yearsyes the numbers do show household debt as a percentage of gdp rising and at the end of last year it was 759 the worry is that it is the largest percentage rise in asia and the memory of the consequences of uncontrolled buildup has been displayed in south korea where the unravelling of its credit card debt sent the economy southwardworking in favour of the economy is that the debt buildup has been supported by household assets which is more than twice that of total household debtfull employment the high savings of malaysians and low nonperforming loans of household debt adds to the cushion for the regulator in assessing the overall situation with household debt and the potential systemic risk it posesin bank negara governors statement in the financial stability and payment systems report 2010 tan sri dr zeti akhtar aziz says that while household indebtedness has increased in the recent years it has continued to be supported by strong financial buffers at the aggregate level“income growth the high savings rate and favourable employment conditions have contributed to supporting the debt servicing capacity of households” she says in her statement“to ensure that this does not become a source of financial instability a comprehensive series of policies were introduced during the course of the year these include prudential policies applied in the residential property sector new credit card measures and strengthened requirements for banks to adopt prudent and responsible lending practices this was reinforced by more intensive supervisory oversight of financial institutions with respect to the management of household lending portfolios” she saysthe governor adds in her statement that more targeted financial education programmes as well as advisory and support arrangements have also served to promote responsible borrowing by households these preemptive and more holistic measures also aim to contribute towards further strengthening the resilience of the household sectorthe central bank uses the financial stability policy committee a forum that assess risks to financial stabilitythe financial stability policy committee also works with the monetary policy committee which sets the overnight policy rate in coming up with macroprudential responses for the economysome examples how those committees have worked together has been the recent steps taken to put some brakes in household debt and consumption creditthe central bank last year had imposed a maximum loantovalue ratio of 70 for people wanting to buy their third or more homeslatest data do indicate demand for housing loans is starting to cool banks are paying more attention to applications of borrowers to weed out speculative borrowing but the impact will only be known in the march data to see if the drop is seasonal like it is at the beginning of any yearthe next measure bank negara took was to raise the minimum income limit to rm24000 per annum for people to be eligible for a credit card it is also limiting the number of credit cards to two for people earning less than rm36000 a yearthe reason for worry for credit cards stemmed from the growing use of credit for transaction purposesbank negara says that despite a reduction in the number of cards owned by households following the imposition of a rm50 fee by the government on credit cards in 2010 outstanding credit card balances increased by 152 to rm308bil at the end of last year to account for 53 of household debts it further says that outstanding balances per credit card holder rose by 151 to rm9516 as at end2010“the number of credit card holders with revolving balances excluding defaulters accounted for 479 of total credit card holders more than half of credit card holders with revolving balances were those earning an annual income of rm36000 and below” it says in the reportmeanwhile the level of nonperforming loans npls ratio for credit cards issued by banks and nonbanks remained low at 17the next step bank negara is taking is to stresstest individual borrowers to gauge if they can afford a new loan once new guidelines are introduced in the third quarter of this yearthe new guidelines are designed to inculcate responsible lending practices by financial institutions when dealing with retail customers where borrowers will be subject to a suitability and affordability assessment and verification of incomethe reason for that is while there are education programmes to inform young borrowers about getting into debt and how to manage their finances clamps need to be also put in place because the last thing anyone wants is a homegrown subprime crisisin tackling the affordability angle one area where consumption credit in still left unchecked and unregulated is personal financing from development financial institutions dfis cooperatives and building societieswhile a large fraction of household borrowings is collateralised as 453 of such financing was for the purchase of residential properties personal financing has increased significantly in recent periodsbank negara says in 2010 outstanding personal financing grew by 175 to account for 146 of household debt 2006 96 dfis coops and building societies accounted for the bulk of this growth with almost 80 granted under salary deduction schemes“given the salary deduction feature credit assessments by these institutions are mostly limited to a reliance on incomplete computations of debtservicing ratios which are applied for the purpose of qualifying for the salary deduction facility” the central bank says “the absence of robust credit and affordability assessments will result in households being more at risk of becoming overindebted while the risk of defaulting on financing obligations including those obtained from other banking institutions will be higher for borrowers who have overborrowed”the central bank says excluding the dfis personal financing exposures of commercial banks increased at a lower rate of 13 to account for 86 of banking system household loans sound underwriting standards have largely been maintained by banks in terms of financing limits tenures and pricing for these exposures\r\n",

      "petaling jaya five accounting firms were the first to run into trouble with the audit oversight board aob because they had accepted appointments last year as auditors of public interest entities pies without first registering with the boardthree listed companies  britetech bhd cn asia corp bhd and mintye industries bhd  were among those that had engaged these firms when it was illegal for them to act as auditors of piesafter detecting these cases in its monitoring of the agms of pies the aob sent showcause letters to the five firms asking them to explain why they had failed to register with the board before agreeing to become auditors of the pies however because the regulatory framework for auditors was just introduced last april the firms have been spared stiff penalties and are allowed to audit the financial statements of piesaob executive chairman nik mohd hasyudeen yusoff said that the idea behind setting up the board was to ensure robust oversight of auditors as such it viewed any breach of law seriouslyhe added that the aob had dealt swiftly with the five firms and had sent “a very strong signal” that it would not tolerate such incidents in the future“having considered the firms explanations and considering that this is the first year that the new law is implemented we issued warning letters to them we also require them to do certain reporting to us on a periodical basis to make sure that they are in compliance with the law they are now registered these are issues that we faced at the early stage of implementing this new law” he told starbizthe securities commission act 1993 was amended last year to provide for the establishment of the aob and for related matters among other things the new rules require that an auditor of a pie be registered with the aob pies include listed companies banking and financial institutions including islamic banks and development financial institutions insurance companies and takaful operators and holders of capital market services licences such as securities and futures trading firms and fund management companiesthe amendments came into effect on april fools day last year which was also the day the aob commenced operations this meant that auditors that were due to be reappointed in agms scheduled to be held in the first few days of april had to quickly register with the boardgiven that many of their audit clients are pies the larger firms were naturally among the earliest to be registered for example ernst amp young ey and pricewaterhousecoopers pwc were registered on april 1 itself while kpmg got into the aob register of auditors on april 9mohd hasyudeen explained that the board could register ey and pwc on its first day because a lot of groundwork had been done earlier to ensure that the firms knew the criteria for registration and could thus submit applications with the necessary information and documentationhe said “we approved the applications on april 1 because we were satisfied that they met the criteria we were able to make these decisions because we had made all the preparations”prior to april the securities commission had made available the registration handbooks and forms and had fielded enquiries about the registration processanother factor that figured in the aobs speedy approval of registration applications was the need to avoid disruptions in the pies appointment of auditors“agms had already been scheduled and we did not want to see companies having to postpone the meetings and incurring costs just because the auditors could not accept appointments after failing to register in time“we preempted all these issues to make sure there was a smooth transition and implementation we are in the confidencebuilding business news that companies have failed to appoint auditors may not be positive so we cautiously manage that process” mohd hasyudeen saidfor the board there is an additional layer of assurance in the fact that a criterion for aob registration is that the auditors must already be approved by the finance ministry under section 8 of the companies act 1965 under the companies act the finance minister gives such an approval to a company auditor when satisfied that the applicant is “of good character and competent to perform the duties of an auditor under this act”mohd hasyudeen pointed out that the registration process is not the only time that the auditors are subject to the aobs scrutiny “if the auditors are registered and subsequently we find that they have not been truthful to us  say they have submitted misleading information or have omitted important information  we will act against them thats why we conduct inspections of auditors” he addedthe aob declined to provide details of the five accounting firms that have been given warnings however by comparing announcements on the bursa malaysia website with the boards register of auditors starbiz has found that three firms had been appointed auditors of listed companies before they had been registered with the aob see table on b1 another three were appointed on the same day their applications for registration were approvedon the status of the latter three mohd hasyudeen said “we registered them because we were satisfied that they had fulfilled our requirements we take it that they were each registered on that particular date”\r\n",

      "this is the second in a threepart questionandanswer series provided by pricewaterhousecoopers for the star readers on various aspects of budget 2005 the final part will appear in starbiz tomorrow q the finance minister in presenting his 2005 budget speech spoke on establishing a fund for tax refund can you explain what is the effect   a when the government introduced assessment on the currentyear basis as well as the self assessment system sas there are companies which have made excess payments on their tax these companies are entitled to claim refund from the government  up to now there has been no change in the procedure of paying refund as tax collected under the income tax act goes into the consolidated fund and cannot be used to make refund   the inland revenue board irb has to obtain the necessary fund from the treasury if the treasury does not provide the fund the irb would not be in a position to make the refund   with the establishment of a fund for tax refund tax collected can be allocated into the fund as determined by the finance minister directly and the irb would be allowed to utilise the monies from the fund to make refund  this will certainly improve the governments delivery system as refunds will be made in a shorter period   q the finance minister has announced that there will be changes in claiming the industrial building allowance for purchase of a used industrial building my company intends to buy a used building to expand its activities can you advise me how the proposed change will impact my claim on the industrial building  a the proposed change is to overcome the difficulty faced by the taxpayer ie the acquirer of the used industrial building in computing the annual allowance ie industrial building allowance iba   based on the current law the acquirer of a used building can claim iba based on the tax residual value of the construction cost ie construction cost less allowances claimed to date the acquirer would have to obtain the information on the construction cost from the vendor the acquirer may have difficulty in obtaining the information   the proposed change in law is to simplify the claim for iba as the basis of the computation of iba will be calculated on the current purchase price notwithstanding that the disposer will be subject to the balancing allowance or balancing charge in your case say if the purchase price of the building is rm1mil the company will be entitled to claim initial allowance of 10 and annual allowance of 3 in the year of acquisition   q the recent budget proposed that interestinsuspense be deemed as specific provision for bad debts and allowed a full deduction in the computation of income tax does this apply to stockbroking companies  a section 34 of the income tax act 1967 ita governs the tax treatment of provision for doubtful debts the new section 34 subsection 3b of the income tax act 1967 defines a “bank” as a bank or finance company or a banking and finance company licensed or deemed to be licensed under the banking and financial institutions act 1989 or islamic banking act 1983 or an institution prescribed under the development financial institutions act 2002 stockbroking companies appear not to be covered by the above provision   q the government has increased the duty for cigarettes again this year  as a smoker can i know how much will the price of cigarettes be increased  a the 2005 budget has announced a change in the duty structure for cigarettes the changes in the rate of import duty and excise duty are as follows  old import duty rm200kg new import duty rm020stick  old excise duty rm58kg new excise duty rm811000 sticks   the minister of finance in his budget speech mentioned an increase in excise duty rates to promote a healthy lifestyle the increase in excise duty to be around 40 for imported as well as locally manufactured cigarettes the increase in the excise duty would also increase the amount of sales tax paid   the impact of the increase on the consumer would ultimately depend on how much of the increase will be passed down by the tobacco manufacturers and importers the higher costs will increase the incidence of cigarette smuggling and would have to be addressed by the authorities   q the abolishment of the import duty on semifinished components for the woodbased industry would benefit the construction industry would this benefit be passed on to the property buyers  a although construction costs are expected to be reduced in the case where imported components are used the benefit may be minimal it would be up to the developers to determine how much of the reduction if any to be passed to the property buyers   q it was anticipated that budget 2005 will be a “caring” budget  how will budget 2005 benefit the man in the street  a the proposals that will benefit individual taxpayers at large include the following which will come into effect beginning in year of assessment 2005  ·the relief for the purchase of books to increase from rm500 to rm700 to promote the reading habit  ·the limit on relief for epf contributions andfor insurance premium to be increased from rm5000 to rm6000 and  ·the rebate for the purchase of a personal computer to increase from rm400 to rm500 to promote the penetration of ict into the malaysian society  part onegst to replace sales and services

      "amid the interest in glc revamps it is easy to forget those that are not listed undercapitalised and burdened by bad loans bank industri amp teknologi malaysia needs rejuvenation the process has already begun says othman mohd rijal amid the expectation that a successful revamp of governmentlinked companiesglcs will boost the stock marketit is easy to forget that not all ofthese companies are listed for thatmatter some of them will never getto bursa malaysia simply becausemaking profits is not their raisondêtre however even for these companies there is no escaping the mounting pressure to perform better bank industri amp teknologi malaysia bhd knows all about this it celebrated its 25th anniversary last month but this year is meaningful not just because of the silverjubilee undercapitalised and burdened by the highrisk lending it is called upon to provide bank industri is reshaping itself the restructuring is expected to be completed by the yearend the idea is to become stronger in dealing with changes in the financial services business and in the strategic sectors that the bank focuses on over the years the banks basic role has been the same – to give medium to longterm financing to strategic capitalintensive industries what have changed significantly are the nature of these industries and the ability of the domestic capital market to finance their businesses bank industri chairman tan sri othman mohd rijal says the bank must reposition itself to continue to be effective in its role as a development financial institution dfi thatsupports these strategic sectors he points out that the bank has to keep up with rapid advances in hightechnology industries so that it can continue to offer financialproducts that meet the demand of these industries in addition dfis are perhaps no longer the no1 option when a highrisk business needs financing venture capital and debt securities have become reliable alternatives for bank industri restructuring is a necessary response says chairman tan sri othman mohd rijal “we have to repair and clean our balance sheet and address capitaladequacy issues of course we next have to improve the bank’s organisational structure processes and operations” the basis of the exercise is an ongoing review done jointly with professional service firm kpmg and rating agency malaysia bhd ram a development that was instrumental in pushing the bank towards some serious selfexamination was the enactment of the development financial institutions act which took effect in february 2002 following this the bank and two main subsidiaries exportimport bank of malaysia bhd exim bank and malaysia export creditinsurance bhd mecib came under bank negaras supervision along with that came the inevitable comparison with other players in the banking sector at the same time the governments push to reform glcs including the introduction of kpis key performance indicators addsimpetus to bank industris restructuring efforts “we welcome this initiative because it brings the management and direction of the business in line with what is stipulated in the act which essentially emphasises goodmanagement prudential risk management and of course capital adequacy” othman explains the dfi difference when stacked up against say the countrys commercial banks bank industri looks very much like a poor cousin the latters riskweighted capital ratio rwcr is 29 a negative ratio means that the capital base is insufficient to cover the assets including loans and its net nonperforming loans npl ratio as at june was 135 according to bank negaras july statistics the commercial bankss rwcr and net npl ratio stood at 142 and 58 the overall banking system had a rwcr of 139 and anet npl ratio of 62 however because bank industri is a dfi there is room to argue that it and commercial banks do not even belong to the same family “in a way we are a slightly different creature” says othman in a few ways actually to begin with the bank was set up in 1979 to fill a gap in the financial system back then commercial banks were reluctant – and understandably still are – to take on the high risk thatcomes with lending to certain businesses in the maritime and manufacturing industries but these industries were deemed important to the nations development goals and thus dfis like bank industri were required tofinance such businesses naturally that has led to a loan portfolio that has a disproportionate amount of assets of lesser quality says othman “if we were to apply prudence in the same way it is applied among commercial banks we wouldnt be lending anything” another key difference is that bank industri was left out in the restructuring of the banking sector in the wake of the asian financial crisis for example it did notreceive capital injection from danamodal nasional bhd but it is clear that there is a need to address the banks weak rwcr indeed the bank has sought fresh capital from the government – minister of finance inc owns bank industri – and at one time had apparently fancied its chances of getting a positive response in a rating review published last march ram says it had been “given to understand” that the government had agreed to restore the rwcr toat least 8 according to the rating agency that would need a capital injection of about rm800mil “the government’s plan to recapitalise the bank is viewed positively by ram although we believe that it may take some time before the actual capital injection takes place”says the report it will be a long wait bank industri is now resigned to making do without recapitalisation by the government othman says the capital injection is not likely to happen because the government is now intent on balancing the budget “i think we have to figure out ways how to repair the banks capital structure ourselves” floating to the top in that respect it helps that bank industri has some useful investments on its

maritime ventures bhd gmv bank industri still holds over 20 in the shipping company “its alreadylisted and we will harvest the proceeds from there” says othman in addition the bank is banking on gaining from the possible flotation of another shipping business according to gmvs 2003 annual report it operated 12 vessels injoint venture with wawasan shipping sdn bhd a unit of the imc group which is controlled by shipping magnate tan sri frank tsao the listing proposal is still in the planning stages but bank industri hopes to reap almost rm1bil in cash flow when it eventually disposes of its shares in the two shipping companies “that should bring us to a positive rwcr of 14 to 18 depending on how we package the deals thats way above the minimum banknegara requirement of 8” othman says “we consider ourselves very lucky because we have made very good investments that are maturing at the right time” but he concedesthat the bank cannot depend on lady luck to bail it out the next time he says because of the kind of lending it does and the portfolio it carries it may well be back to square one in a matter of a few years he adds that the bank shouldbe compensated by other measures if a capital injection is not forthcoming the rwcr formula is a source of contention the banks group managing director datuk md noor yusoff says the formula requires thebanks investment in subsidiaries to be taken out of the banks capital base he argues “we have to create so many subsidiaries given our small capital we have to borrow from the market to increase it the ratio is negative but we still continue our operations like normal and theinvestments in the subsidiaries are still good investments” othman takes a somewhat different approach he views it as a positive that bank industri is included in the authorities moves to strengthen the countrys banking systemand culture at the same time he feels that bank industris responsibility for supporting highrisk ventures has to be taken into account “the standards as applied by bank negara relates to the business of lending and finance you cant use a different measurement a measurement is a measurement thats it youve got to accept that “but when the subject matter doesnt really fit into the framework of standards you have to look into what can be done to remedythat at policy and structural levels”when asked if the bank has figured out the remedial measures othman says this is being done as part of the strategic review “whether the government will accept it the banks proposal or whether it has other approaches i wouldnt know” related storya major role in the countrys development \r\n",

'when prime minister tan sri muhyiddin yassin announced his stimulus package it appeared at first glance a commendable even an impressive feat by his government to respond to the covid19 pandemic however two key points merit assessment of the perikatan nasional governments response to this crisis first when muhyiddin addressed the nation remarkably enough he began by admitting that his government may not be the government you voted for this was an astonishing admission by the prime minister that he was aware many malaysians question the legitimacy of his perikatan government the second point was his resolve to use governmentlinked companies glcs to deal with the crisis this too was an intriguing admission that he as prime minister had control of powerful businessrelated governmentlinked institutions that he could deploy during this crisis indeed finance minister tengku zafrul abdul aziz would later draw reference to a government ecosystem according to the finance minister direct fiscal injection would come from government agencies and related parties in this ecosystem zafrul was not clear though of the source of borrowings by the government to fund this stimulus package muhyiddins admission of his control of major glcs that have funds and other resources to support people and businesses in need was an indication of two core matters first malaysia is a highly interventionist state with a welldeveloped institutional architecture to stimulate the economy and protect the interests of people in need second a politicalbusiness nexus is in place in government with the power that comes from such ties concentrated in the hands of the prime minister this influential ecosystem created in the 1970s to resolve social injustices though now critiqued as a moneypower nexus has long remained in the shadows in spite of repeated public demand for transparency about this government ecosystem no prime minister has been willing to do so even after the economic crises in 1997 and 2008 in this time of the covid19 crisis there is a particular need to analyse how this powerful politicalbusiness nexus is being – or not being – employed in this stimulus package what muhyiddin and zafrul referred to as glcs it must be stressed includes much more than publiclisted companies controlled by the government such as the utilitiesbased tenaga nasional and telecom and the financialbased maybank cimb rhb bank and bank islam this ecosystem includes pension and savings funds such as epf and pnb statutory bodies like mara and felda and development financial institutions or dfis such as sme bank exim bank and agro bank the prime minister has stated though with little clarity how some of these glcs will be employed tenaga nasional along with the government according to muhyiddin will offer a discount on power consumption that will amount to rm530mil telecommunications firms will offer free internet services with the government allocating rm600mil for this presumably glcs in these sectors will absorb these costs as for the glc banks they will offer loan moratoriums though this will not mean huge losses for them as these are merely deferred payments epf though a pension fund will allow for withdrawals to help people meet their expenses during this crisis most of these measures as well as other aspects of the stimulus package have already begun to draw much criticism why for example in this health related crisis have the glcbased hospitals not been included in this stimulus package glc hospitals such as kpj and pantai as well as those controlled by sime darby were not mentioned though muhyiddin called on private hospitals to help the government and what of pharmaceuticalsbased pharmaniaga as well as uemedgenta which provide healthrelated services indeed uemedgenta has been criticised for not treating its workers well during this pandemic there is no need for these major health financial and utilitiesbased glcs to worry about registering huge profits other criticisms have emerged particularly involving epf ngos have admonished the government for calling on malaysians especially those in the b40 to use their meagre savings to share responsibility to reflate the economy the sme association has reacted badly to the stimulus package claiming that 50 of such firms will wind down with at least four million people losing their jobs these smes constitute about 98 of the corporate sector since the finance minister has stated that the stimulus package will entail a reallocation of funds among governmentlinked agencies other related issues arise why not reallocate funds in dfis such as sme bank midf bank pembangunan and exim bank to small and micro firms which are in dire need to remain afloat why not employ agro bank and bank rakyat to help rural industries to ensure continued food production and supply and what about statutory bodies such as mara kesedar ketengah risda and felcra created to support small and rural industries these institutions have in fact been long abused for patronage and distribution of concessions to obtain political support indeed soon after the perikatan government took power it changed the board of directors of mara which has oversight of a huge business base there is a wellframed institutional architecture in this government ecosystem that has been used in the past to allow the government to intervene in the economy to achieve noble goals these businessrelated government institutions can be employed to get help quickly to the ground during this crisis there is however little indication in this stimulus package that the prime minister is using this government ecosystem effectively to deal with this pandemic in fact while trying to channel funds to people to increase consumption to sustain the economy the government appears equally preoccupied with helping major glcs remain profitable keeping a powerful politicalbusiness nexus in placeafter all the prime minister himself admitted in his speech he also has to deal with a political crisis if ever there was a time to expose this powerful glc world and for politicians to dispense with using this power nexus to consolidate their position in government it is now importantly too since this shadow governments ecosystem will be deployed to fuel the economy by an administration whose legitimacy is in question it is imperative that parliament be convened to debate this stimulus package prof terence gomez specialises in political economy and is the dean of the economics and administration faculty

in a statement yesterday that prime minister tun dr mahathir mohamad will announce an economic stimulus package on feb 27 in response to the impact from the covid19 outbreak he adds that the economic stimulus package is neither a new budget nor part of budget 2020 measures instead assistance will be given to the affected sectors to allow the economy to emerge as whole as possible and benefit from the expected economic rebound postcovid19 according to lim the emphasis of the stimulus package would be on exploring alternative revenues such as shifting towards encouraging domestic tourism and sourcing from other marketsthis also involves keeping the domestic labour market resilient while ensuring our soft and physical infrastructure remain in place amid the shortterm weakened demand  lim says a fiscal stimulus if properly applied to the relevant sectors would improve market sentiment spur local demand and reduce economic losses caused by covid19 and the uschina trade war the problem

government had proposed to merge four dfis namely bpmb danajamin exportimport bank of malaysia bhd exim bank and small medium enterprise development bank malaysia bhd sme bank to strengthen the development finance ecosystem via a twophased restructuring plan to form a new financial institution the first phase of the restructuring plan will involve the merger of bpmb with danajamin and the second phase to merge exim bank and sme bank into the earlier merged entity the smooth implementation of the restructuring plan would be overseen by a steering committee led by the finance ministry the steering committee consists of representatives from credit guarantee corp malaysia bhd bank negara and the four dfis as well as relevant stakeholder ministries including the economic affairs ministry the entrepreneur development ministry and the international trade and industry ministry meanwhile a working committee which would provide updates on the merger progress would also support the steering committee in driving the implementation of the key integration aspects of the merger given the expected merger of the four dfis a banking analyst from kenanga research told starbiz that the merger is expected to largely tap the financing for entrepreneurs as well as smes driven by bpmbs mandate to provide medium and longterm financing to the strategic sectors of the economy right now getting financing for the sme sector is tough given the weak business sentiment hence conventional banks see the sme market and unsecured businesses as high risk to provide financing however this merger would extend its financing to the sme business which is a big market as it faces difficulty in getting financing from conventional banks  he added overall sme lending is seeing faster growth than total loan growth this year according to midf research senior analyst imran yassin bpmb was incorporated in 1973 with the role of assisting entrepreneurs involved in sme industries through the provision of various financing facilities training and advisory services particularly to bumiputra entrepreneursthrough its wholly owned subsidiary pembangunan leasing corp sdn bhd plc bpmb also provides financing to sme businesses including those involved in manufacturing construction supply transportation agriculture hospitality and information technology as of dec 312018 bpmb had a combined asset value of rm247bil reflecting that the group is wellpositioned to meet the financing and business development needs of malaysian businesses in the priority sectors with the global economy slowing down the analyst noted that merging danajamin could be useful in the merger as the bank would be able to capitalise the banking system should there be a rise in nonperforming loans moving forward this merger would strengthen the capital adequacy ratio so it can continue to expand its lending to the sme sector and unsecured businesses  he added the governments proposal to merge four dfis in the country could create an entity with a larger balance sheet that in turn could result in greater efficiencies and better cost controls however with these institutions serving different mandates the operational side would be something that the government would need to address according to industry players another likely issue that could crop up with the proposed merger is staffing where there will bound to be duplications and overlaps in some operations postmerger finance minister lim guan eng said in his budget 2020 presentation that dfis played an important role as public institutions that support the nations development goals and serve the needs and requirements of the new economy the possible merger of local dfis in malaysias already crowded and competitive banking space had been discussed sometime back but did not take off previously in a statement issued by bpmb it said that the proposal to strengthen the dfi ecosystem is a positive development our business lines are complementary to the other institutions and the proposal will lead to greater synergies that would benefit all stakeholders as well as fulfil the needs of the new economy  it added dfis in malaysia were established in the 1960s and 1970s as specialised financial institutions with specific mandates to develop strategic sectors spanning agriculture infrastructure smes as well as exportoriented and hightechnology industries notably in 2008 sme bank was made a separate entity from its parent company the bpmb group for the year ended dec 312018 bpmbs net profit fell 215 to

higher than expectednevertheless the projected current balance of rm35bil was just slightly above the forecast rm3bilthe budget 2020 tabled last week is looking at economic growth of 48 which is within the expected range of between 45 and 5 it will be challenging given the expected growth is to be mainly driven by private consumption smaller contraction in public investment and but dragged by a drop in net exports as imports growth is expected to surpass exports next year on the supply side the significant contribution from the construction sector growth is not a surprise given some of the mega projects will likely kick off next year while the services sector too is expected to be sustained at more than 6 growthbudget 2020 had several hits and misses while it raised minimum wage to rm1200 it is still short of the rm1500 targetat the same time the call to widen the tax revenue base was not fulfilled the introduction of a new tax bracket of 30 for high income earners of above

be sold to foreign buyers beginning next year for a period of one yearhopefully this would help developers sitting on these types of properties and to clear the existing overhang in the market in addition the renttoown scheme is good for firsttime home buyers while the change in the base year for the purposes of real property gains tax rpgt to the year 2013 from 2000 is a welcome relief although still not widely accepted for administrative purposes it is always better to calculate rpgt to the year the property is purchased and not any base year as valuation of a property at a given

reductionwith the commitment from the government that extension period for toll concessionaires is not going to be extended it is likely the two or three proposals that are siting on the desk of the minister or the prime minister will continue to collect dusttheir proposals while entailing even larger discounts than that proposed by the minister lack the commitment to end tolling in 2038 hence it is likely that their proposals are not going to see the light of day given the unspoken line it is now likely that either khazanah or the epf to take the lead to buy out one or the other logically as

ongoing struggle to attract funds into the islamic banking space the big chunk of the deposits in islamic banks are institutional deposits he told starbiz    badlisyah who is also the president of the chartered institute of islamic finance professionals ciif added that islamic banks need to do more to attract funds and spur growth   although he expected growth in islamics but it was still relatively small compared with conventional deposits in the past he noted that islamic deposits had been growing by doubledigit but now it was growing by a singledigit   badlisyah noted that it was a concern if one were to look at the asset size of both islamic and conventional banking for islamic banking with its total asset size of about rm917bil it should be growing by at least a doubledigit if not by tripledigit this total asset size figure includes development financial institutions but this is not the case he said noting that at the same time this was merely an adjustment phase for the islamic banking industry similar to other industries  on islamic banking asset  badlisyah said it had been growing albeit at a moderate rate he attributed it to among others the consolidation in the islamic banking space and compliance of new rules required by the regulators he viewed this as temporary and was confident banks would continue with their asset building exercise once they have sorted out the above issues meanwhile ram ratings in its latest edition on islamic banking said islamic financing is still anchoring the growth of the overall malaysian banking sector it noted that islamic banking continued to expand at a much faster pace than conventional loans in 2018 coming in at 11 2017 103 in contrast to the latters 33 growth as of endjanuary 2019 islamic financing comprised some 32 of the overall systems loans the rating agency expected financing growth of the islamic banking sector to stand at around 10 to 11 in 2019  as for the valuebased intermediation vbi which is gaining momentum in islamic finance  badlisyah noted that this practice was good for islamic finance over the long term albeit some hiccups in the short term he said banks would need to be not only profitcentric but also sociallyoriented  over the long term vbi would strengthen islamic banking including earning prospects and outweigh costs vbi is an intermediation function that aims to deliver the intended outcomes of syariah through practices conduct and offerings that generate positive and sustainable impact to the economy community and environment consistent with the shareholders sustainable returns and longterm interests the biggest challenge for islamic banks badlisyah said is complacency  there is growth in the industry but only singledigit and more must be done to spur the industry although the islamic banking industry has invested the best resources and infrastructure but there is still room for further growth he stressed  there must be selfreflection on the part of the industry as to what  needs to be done to further propel islamic banking this is the question which needs to addressed by the industry he said as for the ciif which have about 1000 members

in the survey which covered firm and entrepreneur characteristics business performance and challenges as well as access to finance and usage of financial services the survey showed that more than 90 of the smes served the domestic market with 7 exporting their products and services about 83 of smes reported utilising information and communications technology ict in their business operations with 22 that have their own website and 14 that operate online stores more than half of the respondents 53 used professional services including auditors accountants or financial advisors to manage their financial accounts says the central bank despite the challenging business environment in the first quarter of 2018 the majority of smes 71 recorded profit margins of above 10 and were able to maintain positive cash flows says bank negara manufacturing firms reported higher levels of productivity and paid higher wages for new graduate hires compared to other sectors on financing the central bank says respondents reported utilising funds from a variety of sources both internal and external with own cash contributions being the main source among other funding sources about 27 of the respondents had facilities with financial institutions followed by family and friends internallygenerated funds and microfinance institutions in the microenterprise segment 22 had financing facilities with financial institutions including 9 of respondents who secured financing under the pembiayaan mikro facility bank negara says sources of financing also vary through the business life cycle at the initial stage young firms tend to rely on their own cash and informal sources such as family and friends this is consistent with most research findings which attribute such behaviour typical of young firms to information opacity lack of collateral track record and financial skills as well as high transactional costs as businesses mature typically after five years in operation they tend to rely more on external financing in the form of both debt and equity including bank financing among the smes that had applied for financing most indicated that they were able to secure financing says the

womenowned firms applied versus 22 for all respondents but experienced a lower approval rate of 83 overall 94 mainly due to the lack of track record and insufficient documentation most of these firms obtained unsecured financing from microfinance institutions banking institutions and development financial institutions bank negara says adding that about 44 of the respondents were firsttime borrowers the main purposes of the financing applications were for the purchase of assets building property machinery and equipment 23 working capital 22 and starting a new business 19 on average the

financial services such as insurance takaful and epayments more than half of the respondents have insurance or takaful products although this was less prevalent among microenterprises  while the current takeup has been low potential future demand for insurance and takaful by smes is significant for all products across the board with emerging interest particularly in securing protection for risks associated with cyber security professional indemnity payment default and damages in crops the survey noted that smes mainly made electronic payments but preferred cash in receiving payments from customers it was also observed that cheques remained popular for payments to suppliers and other business to business transactions underlying challenges in financing with regards to challenges the survey reveals that financing barriers mainly relate to documentation costs and business viability among the key constraints to business growth difficulty in accessing sufficient financing was ranked low second to last out of the nine constraints identified by smes says the central bank it says smes that experienced rejections of their financing applications cited insufficient documentation insufficient cash flow to meet repayments and nonviable business plans as the main reasons for rejection smes involved in automation innovation manufactures of goods and exports experienced higher rejection rates compared to the overall smes firms that automated stated insufficient collateral and projects perceived to be of higher risk as key reasons for rejection the rejected applications were mainly for the purchase of machinery and equipment and ict tools as well as undertaking research and development bank negara says these projects could be deemed to be higher risk as they may involve moveable and intangible assets with low salvage value in the event of commercial failure and involve the use of new and untested processes with high uncertainty on returns innovative firms cited insufficient documentation as a key factor for rejection exporting and manufacturing firms that faced greater difficulty obtaining financing were mainly firms that were newly established with limited repayment track records businesses that needed financing but did not apply 41 were either cautious in taking on debt unsure of their repayment capacity or found the application process too difficult the survey revealed that about 46 of the respondents stated that the financing products offered by financial institutions did not meet their business needs due to high financing costs 50 insufficient

the police especially had a decent number of chinese which was instrumental in our successful thwarting of the communist party of malaya cpm insurgents and urban terrorists it was the infiltration of these chinese policemen into the cpm with the many dangerous and highly classified covert operations of the police special branch and military intelligence which defeated the cpm from the 1960s to the late 1970s nonmalay armed forces personnel comprised about 30 of the total manpower while the navy and air force excluding the army had a higher percentage over the years this figure gradually dropped to the current 5 certainly no one is blaming the government for this situation since it has openly encouraged nonmalays to join the responsibility of defending the country and the people should be shared by all malaysians so it would be terribly unfair if this mammoth burden is only shouldered by the malays however a combination of factors including perceived low chances of promotion has deterred many nonmalays from joining the ranks despite the tiny representation of the nonmalays in the services especially the police the men and women in uniform have performed professionally nonmalays feel secure and protected even in the wake of incidents involving malay attackers and this must be remembered and in the case of the economy despite the large number of chinese businessmen

had famously referred to malaysias complex ownership structure of governmentlinked companies glcs as a monster  there was irony in this statement because dr mahathir after all had a played a leading role in crea\\xadting this structure that has enterpri\\xadses in every sector of the economy however he noted too that this structure was created to serve a noble vision but the glcs had evolved into tools exploited by politicians to serve their vested interests  there is undoubtedly a deep sense of frustration among malay\\xadsians particularly business people about the pervasiveness of glcs in the economy  the contention is that the glcs crowd out private firms in key economic segments except the industrial and manufacturing sectors under barisan nasional there had been numerous promises to reform the glcs particularly during economic crises critics also note that the presence of influential politicians in the glcs has weakened managerial practices undermining the performance of these firms  through glcs corrupt politicians have channelled concessions to private companies in exchange for campaign contributions something must be urgently done about the glcs however what is brewing as malaysia embarks on an arduous journey of instituting reforms is a serious divide in opinion about how to deal with these glcs the most commonly articulated panacea is to privatise the glcs unfortunately it is not so simple this debate assumes a homogenisation of glcs when in fact there is a variety of such institutions that play different roles in the economy  how we got here the introduction of the new economic policy nep in 1970 precipitated extensive government intervention in the economy the nep was a progressive 20year affirmative action plan to eradicate poverty and equitably redistribute wealth between ethnic groups bumiputera corporate ownership then stood at a mere 15  government intervention entailed establishing public enterprises to acquire primarily foreignowned businesses these public enterprises later renamed glcs were also introduced at the federal and state levels to play a developmental role in the economy among these glcs were development financial institutions tasked with nurturing domestic smes funding ventures in new sectors and promoting rampd  other glcs included sectoralbased institutions to achieve core development goals and socioeconomictype statutory bodies after dr mahathir was first appointed prime minister in 1981 he embarked on privatisation  par\\xadtly to rid the government of the huge number of glcs but also to create a new breed of bumiputra entrepreneurs who owned business conglomerates of international repute he achieved this goal but the 1997 asian currency crisis unravelled his plans  the government had to renationalise many of these privatised companies creating again a public sector that owned a large number of glcs a plan was initiated to reform glcs mainly those listed on the stock exchange professionals from the private sector were hired to manage them while politicians were removed from their boards of directors these professionals most of whom had never served in government were paid salaries benchmarked against private sector remuneration an issue of much contention today  another criticism was that these executives were subservient to the dictates of the prime minister  one outcome of this reform was that these glcs emerged as leading firms since the turn of the century glcs have been among at least seven of malaysias top 10 listed firms glics and listed glcs glcs have however not evolved in a coherently linear direction they are required to fulfil a range of business and social duties implemented by different institutions at the federal level the glcs are primarily owned by five savings and investmentbased institutions the employees provident fund retirement fund inc lembaga tabung haji lembaga tabung angkatan tentera and permodalan nasional bhd sovereign wealth fund khazanah nasional bhd and the governments primary holding company minister of finance inc collectively termed as governmentlinked investment companies glics these seven vary considerably in size and objectives and are ultimately controlled by the finance minister through a complex pyramidtype organisational structure in early 2017 of the 900odd companies listed on bursa malaysia 70 were glcs that is those with a glic as the largest shareholder the 20 largest among these companies known as the g20 accounted for about 42 of the exchanges total market capitalisation what is of concern is that the government has substantial equity interests – ranging from 5 to 37 – in 140 listed firms however the government is not the largest shareholder in these companies instead the majority owners are individuals or foreign enterprises it is unclear why the government has sought to secure such huge shareholdings in these companies that it does not control this sort of equity ownership could well be in order to earn dividends from the companies but such shareholdings can lead to hostile takeovers business owners have long complained of expropriation of their companies by the government ostensibly as part of its equity redistribution exercise fear of expropriation has undermined investor confidence and hampered rampd endeavours to shape globally competitive enterprises reforming the glcs given the scale and scope of government involvement in the malaysian economy urgent reforms are necessary to ensure the glcs function well and are taken out of the overwhelming control of politicians there is no one remedy to deal with this colossal governmentbusiness complex a thoughtful debate is imperative after a comprehensive study of these glcs in the short term institutional reforms can be formulated to ensure accountable and transparent governance of the companies specifically to address concentration of economic power in the finance ministry power has to be devolved to key oversight institutions such as bank negara the securities commission and oppositionled parliamentary committees within glcs autonomous technocratic professionals must be employed based on merit and not ethnicity so that inefficiencies and abuse of power can be curbed these professionals can be appointed by the finance minister who will have jurisdiction over these glcs though subject to parliamentary oversight in the long term as part of the glc reforms there must be a review of how statutory bodies holding companies and foundations function the government should consider the implications of the restructuring on a sectorbysector basis the modes of reforms to be considered include divestment where government presence is not necessary for example in construction media and tourism on the other hand the government would need to retain ownership of glcs in utilities banking oil and gas defence plantations airport services and ports  the transfer of ownership of huge firms in these sectors to private investors may not serve the nations interest however in these cases partial privatisation through the listing of the glcs has been proposed as a way to raise funds while extending equity ownership to private investors the government will retain control of these companies while reforms are being debated it must be considered that glcs have played an important developmental role creating a vibrant domestic privatelyowned enterprise base promoting mechanisms to encourage private firms to venture into new economic sectors and enhancing the development of rural and nichebased enterprises glcs must still play this role evidently a number of issues must be reviewed when reforming this interlocking nexus of government and business it is therefore

give a blank stare an impromptu survey done by starbizweek in kuala lumpurs central business district revealed the extent to which people know about corporate fraud of the 25 people 23 did not know or did not want to comment experts say that corporate fraud is on the rise but that is difficult to ascertain since most research depends on survey respondents perhaps the technology to detect such activities is better and the regulators have become more adept but it is for sure that globalisation of economic activities and technology have also played a part in making fraudulent activities harder to detect or prosecute kroll inc the new yorkbased corporate investigations and risk consulting firm says in a report that fraud is on an increasing trend up 14 in its kroll global fraud report 20152016 from three years ago the report noted that threequarters of survey respondents were victims in the past year the report also says that the number of companies weighed down in terms of financial loss arising from fraud has also increased to 69 last year compared with 64 in 2014  an interesting observation among malaysians is the equating of fraud with corruption while its not exactly the same there is often an element of corruption involved as in people being paid off to turn the other way while fraudulent activity is being committed creative accounting is usually what comes to mind among people who have any opinion at all about corporate fraud  vestra solutions managing consultant and certified fraud examiner gerald pillai points out that developing countries such as malaysia can see fraudulent activities rising especially in economically challenging times while baker tilly monteiro heng corporate advisory partner andrew heng pic says corporate fraud is becoming more complex and has become increasingly difficult for auditors to detect  he adds that this is complicated by organisations forming shell companies abroad to create a semblance of legitimate business transactions  you can create companies overseas and pretend to buy things from you on paper which could look normal until you see the place and there is nothing there  the level of detection and investigative work definitely will need to be increased which will make it even harder for auditors to detect it will not be something that you can instantly pick from the accounts heng says

referring to the suit also noted that its audit reports for 1mdbs financial statements for the financial years ended march 31 2013 fy13 and fy14 can no longer be relied upon because of information in the civil suit that were not available during those periods 1mdb also sent out a statement saying that the audited financial statements for the periods concerned should no longer be relied on in light of the doj suit heng says the 1mdb case is not creative accounting per se but not having the right information on certain assets in certain companies that caused the auditors to withdraw their opinion  referring to the 1mdb case he says the role of auditors have become increasingly tougher and that there is need to give the client the benefit of doubt however in his experience most corporate fraud involving listed companies here will have an element of creative accounting with the intention of manipulating the share price  the transmile group bhd case from 2007 comes to mind this case saw company officials abetting in making misleading statements relating to the airfreight companys revenue in its unaudited consolidated results for the financial year ended dec 31 2006 heng says there is sometimes an element of moneylaundering involved prominent fraud cases among listed companies in malaysia in recent years include kenmark industrial co m bhd linear corp bhd and axis inc bhd all involving creative accounting in corporate malaysias history the bumiputra malaysia finance ltd bmf scandal of 1983 comes to mind as possibly the largest corporate scandal in the country then  the

bank bumiputra  despite there being a royal commission of inquiry set up for this scandal there were no prosecutions with bmf chairman lorrain esme osman living in exile until his death in london in 2011 gerald says fraud needs to be prosecuted rigorously or it becomes part of the corporate culture this sends a wrong message he asserts given the number of prominent corporate scandals in the country in recent years gerald has this to say i think of late we have this coverup sort of attitude where we can always fix things and get away with it it is not to say that nothing is being done where fraud committed by listed companies is concerned the securities commission in its annual report for 2015 shows that 74 of active investigations last year were devoted to insider trading with the remainder for other misconducts such as corporate governance issues fraud and market manipulation  however experts say that there are still weaknesses in the active pursuit and prosecution of corporate fraud cases  they say that the laws are sufficient but enforcement is weak  the statutes that cover fraud and corruption in the country include the malaysian anticorruption commission act 2009 the penal code development financial institutions act 2002 customs act 1967 and the election offences act 1954 it probably comes down to enforcement whether relevant authorities understand these complications  there is a corporate crime division in the police force and whether they want to beef up that division is important says heng  gerald stressed that the relevant authorities need to enforce the law without bias only then can people consciously see that fraud is being taken seriously experts such as heng say if bribery and corruption is lumped in with fraud then the levels of

spreads on the upside to these alternative sources of funding writes joy lee  with credit expected to get tighter this year as the economy slows more and more small and medium enterprises smes are warming up to the idea of alternative financing secretariat for the advancement of malaysian entrepreneurs same ceo neil foo noted that the awareness level on alternative funds among smes was increasing resulting in more companies looking into such options  small businesses have generally been hesitant to explore alternative financing such as those offered by venture capitalists vcs as they require business owners to give up a portion of their stakes in return for funds  according to investors vcs are looking at holding a minimum of 3040 stake in companies that they are investing in  foo said most were also concerned that these new investors might interfere in the daily operations and management of their business this was not necessarily the case he pointed out investors with minority equity will mainly act more as a mentor for smes he assured they would be able to advise on marketing strategies systems and can offer smes access to their networks smes are more open these days to alternative financing such as vcs and more small businesses are becoming aware of this concept with the dissemination of information through financial roadshows our talk programmes as well as same vc programme he added doers knowledge management group sdn bhd business development director ken choo concurred noting that smes were no longer just looking for money but were also seeking strategic investors who would be able to add value to the business the right investors would certainly give the company a boost  notably the government has acknowledged the importance of developing alternative funding for small businesses the revised budget 2016 saw a rm6bil increase in funding to stateowed development financial institution and venture capital funds to provide financing specifically to smes and startup companies although vcs tend to prefer investing in startups with high growth potential foo said they were also looking into other business sectors  vcs are interested in high pe priceearning ratio for ict companies such as apps businesses but now vcs are also expanding to other areas such as fampb companies which can multiply with chain shops even housing developments are being considered now said foo alternatively smes can opt to apply for loans with development financial institutions like sme bank and credit guarantee corp cgc and more recently equity crowdfunding platforms the main problem for most smes in obtaining funds however is the lack of a convincing business proposal according to foo  same recently organised a business proposal seminar to address the challenges faced by smes in generating good business proposals and offered possible solutions to resolve their financial constraints  some 150 participants had the opportunity to learn writing skills and techniques to ensure minimal rate of rejection when applying for loans  the panellists for the seminar included former director of development banking and liaison for sme bank asbullah adnan same advisor and unipacific corporate services executive director and ceo peter phang propellar crowd chief operating officer bryan chung and doerss choo asbullah noted that statistics showed only 7 of proposals for loan get through proposals are rejected mainly due to noncompliance with guidelines and what is perceived to be projects that are not viable among other things for equity crowdfunding chung said it was important that a business proposal was positioned to address a need in the market  the power of the funds is in the hands of the crowd as long as you can convince the crowd you can get the funds  your proposal has to be concise with relevant information it has to be something that strikes a chord and not just mere compliance and standards said

the continuous plunging crude oil price that hovers around us30 per barrel currently as budget 2016 was drawn up based on estimated oil price of us45 per barrel the pressing question raised is whether our government can deal with the mammoth challenge to source for other revenue streams and to cut the expenditure to sufficiently plug the oil revenue gap so as to stay on course in meeting the fiscal deficit and national debt targets of 31 and 55 limit of gross domestic product gdp respectively failing which the countrys sovereign rating may be downgraded resulting in a whole host of ramifications  it is a relief to know that the government is committed to attaining the fiscal targets set and i am pleasantly surprised this can be achieved largely by the rm9bil cut in the development and operating expenditure  the cut is laudable as the budgets operating expenditure had already been reduced by rm8bil when budget 2016 was first prepared compared with budget 2015  it is comforting to see greater discipline in public spending in the past the grouses were that only the rakyat were required to tighten their belts  it seems the revenue gap that needed to be filled is not as wide judging from the mere rm9bil cut on public expenditure  this could be due to the unexpectedly high goods and services tax gst collection of rm51bil since its implementation on april 1 2015 the original forecast for the entire 2016 was only rm39bil  we must acknowledge the introduction of gst is absolutely timely to cushion the adversity facing the malaysian economy  the governments economic transformation programme which also include subsidy rationalisation diversification to the service sector has reduced the countrys dependence on oil revenue from more than 40 of total revenue to 20 currently  it is heartening to note the government did not implement any measures which required the rakyat to fork out more money through income tax and a high in the gst rate doubling the compliance and auditing efforts on tax evaders and restructuring the selling channels in dutyfree islands to plug leakages are continuous actions to ensure unscrupulous businesses are taxed measures that were anticipated but did not materialise included the full withdrawal of labuan duty free status further rollback of tax incentives and hike in stamp duty rate  it is likely that such moves were not implemented as the priority of the government was to maintain a conducive and accommodative business environment to sustain the economy  the government is also providing a special tax relief of rm2000 for individual taxpayers whose monthly salary did not exceed rm8000 which will benefit two million taxpayers and cost the government rm350mil  the 3 reduction for employees contribution to the employees provident fund epf will increase market liquidity and purchasing power of consumers the epf cut would add rm8bil in disposable income to the countrys 138 million workforce and if the money is spent as investment or expenditure within our economy it would boost our gdp of rm12 trillion by about 065  the education and tourism sectors will benefit from the additional rm5bil allocation for study loans and the arrival of chinese tourists without visa respectively  smes and startups would also benefit from the rm6bil fund injected by the development financial institutions and governmentowned venture capital funds  other effective measures the government may consider moving forward include optimising the government sizeable workforce which stands at 16mil now  most of the commercial organisations locally and globally are embarking on rightsizing exercises to optimise resources utilisation and enhance competitiveness  ultimately for an economy to thrive the nations resources should be fully optimised land disposal can be a major revenue stream in the case of singapore government it reaped about s14bil in 2015 from the sale of land  we may fully adopt the public auction process practised by the singapore and hong kong governments  generally people are encouraged by the better than anticipated state of affairs of our fiscal position as well as the bold measures introduced especially on the rm9bil expenditure cut while more measures can be introduced to further consolidate and stimulate our economy  yee wing peng is the country tax leader of deloitte

challenges this is a repeat of what happened to last years national budget  with global crude oil prices sliding to new multiyear lows malaysia  which derives a major portion of its revenue from petroleum sources  has been forced to revise its budget 2016 just three months after tabling it in parliament  and similar to what took place around the same time last year policymakers politicians bankers economists business leaders consumer advocates and journalists had congregated at the putrajaya international convention centre picc over the week to listen to prime minister datuk seri najib tun razaks special address on how the government is going to revise its strategies to weather the current economic challenges faced by the country did the recalibration of budget 2016 meet expectations well going by the reactions of economic stakeholders so far it appeared opinions range from fairly muted to slightly positive alliancedbs research chief economist manokaran mottain for one thinks it is the right move at the right time the governments revised macro targets and revision measures look realistic and progrowth manokaran explains noting that the review of budget 2016 appears targeted at two key macro headwinds facing the country that is depressed crude oil prices that have weighing on the governments fiscal position and subdued private consumption that could strain economic growth cimb research economist maslynnawati ahmad concurs saying we view the recent budget recalibration positively as it tries to balance the need to tighten spending and still be able to act countercyclically to prevent a sharper economic slowdown  the government realistically assumes a bigger shortfall to incorporate the need for relief measures for rakyat to support growth and did not again for second consecutive year attempt to cut back development expenditure as significantly as it always did in the past whenever faced with an unexpected revenue shortfall or increase in spending she explains  a banker with a local financial institution on the other hand says there is no hohum about it we are in a nochoice situation as the economic outlook has become dimmer  new targets and assumptions along with fresh stimulus measures have to be set to be more reflective of the present environment importantly we have to be prepared as we will likely see even tougher times ahead the banker who wants to remain anonymous tell starbizweek on the sidelines after najibs special address at the picc dimmer outlook indeed there are red flags in the economic horizon  depressed crude oil prices aside we are also looking at potentially slower global economic growth this year while world trade remains sluggish  domestically reports about people facing job cuts and retrenchments in certain industries and businesses experiencing drastic drop in sales are increasing three months ago the government still thought malaysias gross domestic product gdp had the potential to grow up to 5 in 2016  but now as highlighted in the recalibrated budget 2016 the government thinks malaysias economic growth will unlikely exceed 45 this year  the countrys gdp nevertheless is still expected to expand by at least 4 this year the best policy strategy now is to focus on growth manokaran argues applauding the governments initiatives to spur private consumption which accounts for more than 53 of the countrys gdp under the recalibrated budget 2016 the government has introduced several measures aimed at boosting household disposable income and alleviate the rising cost of living to support private consumption growth  these include allowing employees contributions to the employee provident fund to be reduced by 3 from march 2016 to december 2017 granting a tax relief of rm2000 to individual taxpayers earning rm8000 or less a month for the 2015 year of assessment and various initiatives to reduce cost of food and essential goods the key to support domestic demand is to boost private consumption by putting money into the pockets of consumers bank negara governor tan sri zeti akhtar aziz explains adding that domestic demand is expected to remain as pillar of growth for malaysias economy amid the soft external environment on whether bank negara would cut interest rates to boost the domestic economy zeti says the prevailing overnight policy rate of 325 remains accommodative enough to support growth whats more important for the countrys economy now is liquidity and thats why we have reduced the statutory reserve requirement srr she explains the srr which is a requirement imposed on commercial banks to ensure that a portion of their funds are placed with the central bank will be reduced from 4 to 35 with effect from feb 1  this measure is expected to inject rm61bil of liquidity into the banking system weak sentiment midf research meanwhile thinks that although some of the new measures under the revised budget 2016 could help cushion the economic slowdown they may not be able to stimulate stronger economic activity due to the critically weak consumer and business sentiment as it is consumer confidence in malaysia has already hit a new low given the poor outlook on the job market and income growth while cost of living continues to increase according to the malaysian institute of economic research mier the consumer sentiment index csi plunged to a record low of 638 points in the fourth quarter of last year  notably the csi has been hovering below the 100point threshold which demarcates between optimism and pessimism since the fourth quarter of 2014  local businesses are also quite pessimistic about the current economic situation  while there is slight improvement in their sentiment business condition index remains in the negative territory at 871 points in the fourth quarter of 2015 analysts point out that there are not many new measures to directly address the needs of the private sector  the only notable one is the rm6bil increase in allocations by development financial institutions and government venture capital funds to benefit startup companies however they reckon that there are already sufficient existing measures to support the private sector  furthermore they note the recalibrated budget 2016 is not a new budget but remains in line with the initiatives and allocation that had been proposed when the original version was unveiled last october fiscal discipline the recalibrated budget 2016 is based on two basecase scenarios one with brent crude which is the international oil benchmark averaging at us30 rm12450 per barrel the other with brent crude averaging at us35 per barrel  this compares with the average oilprice assumption of us48 per barrel used for the original budget 2016 according to secretarygeneral of treasury tan sri mohd irwan serigar abdullah malaysia can withstand sustained oil price decline to us25 per barrel  as long as oil prices remain above that level the country will be able to sustain its economic growth and the recalibrated budget 2016 will remain  but if oil prices were to go any lower than us25 per barrel irwan reckons that there will be great challenges not only for malaysia but also for the global economy brent crude was traded at around us34 per barrel yesterday last week prices of the commodity fell to a 13year low of around us28 per barrel in line with the depressed oil prices the recalibrated budget 2016 projects the governments revenue to decline by 3542 to rm2163bilrm2179bil compared with the originally estimated rm2257bil while its total spending operating and development expenditure will be cut by 3036 to rm2557bilrm2572bil from the initially proposed rm2652bil cuts to operating expenditures are positive in the medium term in our view given the relative difficulty in trimming this spending nomura research says  we are also not overly concerned by cuts in the development spending budget – as we have argued while malaysias public capex disbursement rates are high relative to the rest of the region it is usually less than 100 with an average development spending disbursement rate of 92 between 2011 and 2014 it adds meanwhile manokaran says while the government has been relatively silent on the specific operating and development expenditure it is targeting to slash the commitment to achieve the 31 fiscaldeficittogdp target should augur well for the countrys sovereign rating standings we believe that the credit rating agencies would be content to see this commitment he says  looking ahead though manokaran reckons that the fiscal challenge of balancing the budget by 2020 remains  the government will have to keep future budgets lean as the depressed crude oil price level could remain for a

saw  2 i begin by reciting the translation by the ulama with reference to the words of allah taala in surah alinsyirah that with each difficulty surely there is ease or happiness  3 we should place such confidence in ourselves as well as in the administration and management of the government  4 as the old malay saying goes the coast changes with the tide thus i wish to make a special address

excellent ideas from various levels of ngos representing consumers esteemed businessmen and directors of commercial banks  12 the majority of them are here with us this afternoon thank you for your input  indeed we are all doing this together for our nation  ii comparison of the economic scenario since 19971998  13 first let us reflect on the economic scenario during the asian financial crisis from 1997 to 1998  14 in 19971998 the country experienced an economic recession with gdp recording a negative growth of 74  15 we should not forget that among the significant effects of the recession were the sharp retrenchments increase in inflation reduction in international reserves to rm59 billion and the kuala lumpur stock exchange klse index plummeting to reach 260point level  16 many companies went bust furthermore some of our children including sijil pelajaran malaysia spm school leavers and young graduates had their dreams and aspirations to continue their studies abroad crushed as the government then could not afford to finance them  17 given the situation the leadership of the government then took drastic measures including implementing capital controls and currency pegging the ringgit at 380 to the us dollar  18 banking institutions were rationalised and private sector loans were restructured through the establishment of danaharta and danamodal the government also implemented a stimulus package of rm7 billion to revive the domestic economy  19 the nation again faced an economic recession in 20082009 due to the subprime crisis in the us which impacted the global economy as well as the steep increase in global crude oil prices reaching usd130 per barrel compared with an average of usd70 per barrel in 2007  20 the countrys exports declined by more than 15 this affected consumer and business sentiments  21 during that time i had just been appointed as the minister of finance and without hesitation took immediate measures by announcing the first economic stimulus package amounting to rm7 billion in november 2008  22 a few months later a second stimulus package of rm60 billion was undertaken in march 2009 to continue to stimulate domestic economic activity the second stimulus package also involved initiatives and collaboration between the government and the private sector  23 in addition to the stimulus packages upon assuming the nations leadership and until today the government planned and implemented several initiatives under the national transformation policy ntp  24 the government launched the government transformation programme gtp and the economic transformation programme etp to elevate malaysia to a developed and highincome country by 2020  25 among the achievements of the transformation include strong gdp growth averaging 56 reduction in government fiscal deficit from 67 to 32 as well as manageable inflation rate  26 we are grateful that hardcore poverty has almost been eradicated in addition 18 million job opportunities were created and rakyat 1malaysia initiatives and programmes were introduced such as 1malaysia people assistance bantuan rakyat 1malaysia or br1m 1malaysia book voucher baucar buku 1malaysia or bb1m kedai rakyat 1malaysia kr1m klinik 1malaysia and affordable housing  27 life is not always smooth sailing looking back at the scenario in 2015 malaysia faced several daunting challenges that were unexpected and beyond our control  28 crude oil prices declined from usd100 in 2014 to usd48 per barrel in 2015 crude oil prices have since continued to fall resulting in the recalibration of the 2015 budget  29 last year the countrys oilrelated revenue fell by almost rm14 billion thus on 20 january 2015 on behalf of the government i presented the recalibration of the 2015 budget by rationalising government expenditure as well as revising the fiscal deficit target from 3 to 32 to gdp  30 i would like to emphasise that the recalibration of the 2015 budget was supported by initiatives such as the rationalisation of fuel subsidy which was implemented earlier although it was an unpopular decision  31 all praise is due to allah these measures have been successful in mitigating the impact from declining oil prices and global economic uncertainties  32 indeed international rating agencies such as moodys standard amp poors and fitch remain confident in the nations strong economic fundamentals and financial position by maintaining a good credit rating  33 based on these factors i am confident that the economy will record a growth of 5 and the fiscal deficit at 32 of gdp as targeted for 2015 the gdp growth for 2015 will be announced next month  iii latest economic scenario  34 the global economy is expected to be more challenging in 2016 the latest data by the international monetary fund imf indicates that the global economy will grow at a slower pace from 36 to 34  35 meanwhile world trade is anticipated to moderate from 41 to 34 this is on account of several economies such as south africa the us brazil and china which are also expected to grow at a slower pace  36 this trend proves that we are not alone in facing the global economic challenges other countries too are affected by the current economic uncertainties  37 world crude oil prices have continued to plummet below usd30 per barrel as of yesterday dated brent crude oil prices dropped to usd31 per barrel a reduction of 35 compared to the assumption of usd48 during the tabling of the 2016 budget  38 these developments have a significant effect on the nations revenue the economy of oil producing countries has also been adversely affected  39 furthermore the us dollar continues to strengthen compared to other currencies among the currencies affected are the brazil real 232 china renminbi 57 canadian dollar 113 russian ruble 293 and singapore dollar 56  40 meanwhile the ringgit too has depreciated by 113 against the us dollar from 377 in june 2015 to 425 on 27 january 2016  41 in fact the ringgit is undervalued and does not reflect the true economic fundamentals however the ringgit is expected to better reflect the strength of the economic fundamentals when global financial markets stabilise and oil prices recover to more reasonable levels  iv new measures  42 these developments have increased uncertainties in the global economy and impacted the domestic economy as well as resulted in the rising cost of living of the rakyat  43 recognising this and as a responsible head of the government together with the deputy prime minister and cabinet ministers today we are taking proactive action to announce the implementation of measures under the recalibrated 2016 budget  44 these initiatives are very important to ensure sustainable economic growth and more importantly to safeguard the wellbeing of the rakyat i am confident that together we can overcome these difficult challenges again  we have done it before god willing we can do it again  45 similar to the situation last year i wish to reiterate that the nation is neither in economic nor technical recession  46 in fact with our efforts and prayers the domestic economy continues to remain strong and resilient capable of facing global economic uncertainties  47 in addition to the measures in the 2016 budget i am pleased to announce 11 restructured and recalibrated measures to ensure the economy and financial position remain on the right trajectory  48 measure 1 the government agrees to reduce the employees contribution to the employees provident fund epf by 3 beginning march 2016 to december

tax relief of rm2000 to individual taxpayers with a monthly income of rm8000 or below for the year of assessment 2015  through this measure although the government will forego revenue of rm350 million

the following  i the government will liberalise the control on import quotas or approved permits aps on eight agricultural produce for a temporary period to ensure consistent supply  the produce

government will expand exports to other markets we have to explore new markets through participation in free trade agreements ftas such as the asean economic community aec and the transpacific partnership agreement tppa as well as the upcoming regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep  81 with regard to the tppa which was passed by dewan rakyat late yesterday the allegation by some quarters that we have compromised national sovereignty and were apologetic in defending the bumiputera agenda during the negotiations with tppa members were unfounded  82 it is noteworthy that the governments efforts and firmness during the negotiation process with the members of the tppa have resulted in the acceptance of the bumiputera policy as part of the terms of the agreement at the international level  83 thus the bumiputera agenda is no longer a national agenda but has now been elevated and recognised globally  v conclusion  84 an advanced nation is not solely due to good and appropriate policies but also the contribution from all segments of society  85 we all have a shared responsibility irrespective of the private sector government ngo youth and women and regardless of whether one is a chief executive officer director support staff worker or a small sundry shop owner  86 overall the five key salient points are summarised as follows  first the recalibrated measures announced are proactive transparent and realistic in tandem with the current global economic challenges  second the economy remains resilient and continues to expand driven by domestic economic activity  third the wellbeing of the rakyat will continue to be prioritised and government service delivery will not be compromised  fourth the government is committed to implementing the fiscal consolidation measures and  fifth the recalibration of the budget is centred on the principle of shared responsibility from all segments of society  87 in brief the restructuring and recalibration of the 2016 budget is similar to last year it is not a new budget it is within the range of initiatives and allocation of the 2016 budget approved by parliament  88 it is clear that matters related to the nations economy and finance is not easy to digest and understood by all levels  89 in fact these issues are not solely the responsibility of the nations administration at the highest level  90 borrowing the words of wisdom from the learned ones in life and livelihood in a country with a government everyone must play his part helping each other through thick and thin that is our source of strength  91 hence i hope that every segment plays its part in explaining the current economic situation and initiatives of the government to further strengthen the economy as well as safeguard the wellbeing of the rakyat  92 this means that all groups from the government administration to the learned ones need to explain in greater detail the current situation and challenges to all parties from top to bottom engaging in discussions in mamak stalls over teh tarik to the best of their abilities  93 with that we hope our great grandchildren will recognise all our achievements for malaysias continuity which is not our right but the right of the future generation  94 we hold to the saying of the elders it is better to be silent rather than speak empty words and to give voice to useful matters do not ask what the nation has done for you but ask what we have done for the nation  95 in essence the challenges confronting us currently are not due to the failure of the government to plan but are on account of the global economic crisis which is beyond our control  96 indeed every decision that we make today is the best for the rakyat and will surely be recorded in history furthermore malaysia is neither a failed state nor a bankrupt nation as alleged  97 in fact the reality is the economy is stable with strong growth as well as resilient and competitive  98 let us together pray to

to repay the initial capital that the entrepeneur put at risk the current condition involving the operating business environment and lastly the collateral offered to the bank this is the typical criterias that bankers look at for new companies a business plan that addresses all these factors is deemed bankable and bankers will move on to the next level of checks which may involve going for

bankers to give them bigger loans whereas bankers expect borrowers to provide more documents to justify their loan application koong said elaborating further he said bankers should understand what he called the 4ms and how entrepreneurs function they are money manpower marketing and management in the last m the entrepreneur has to manage all the 3ms of money manpower and marketing he said koong said as a result of the gap in expectations surveys conducted by acccim show that 80 of new entrepreneurs rely on funds from their own savings friends or family members some even go to ah longs loan sharks on the other hand some also use their credit cards to draw cash advances despite the higher interest rate and upfront fees simply because the automated teller machine will not ask you for a business proposal or other 5c criteria he said teoh feels that entrepreneurs should try to address the doubts of bankers via their business plan and be clear about what their business is we have across entrepreneurs who do not know that their financial background will be checked and some have no idea how big a loan they really need the worst is they try to start a business just because they see a trend and try to follow teoh said koong added that another document that bankers will look at is financial statements if these do not show that the business can make money that there is no cash flow how is the entrepreneur going to repay the bank he asked having said that there are genuine entrepreneurs who needs financing and understanding the issue the forum concluded that banks should emulate what cedar is doing by providing training to entrepreneurs koong said banks have the resources to pool their expertise particularly in investment banking to put up analysis on various industries that smes are in to help their sme lending units make better decisions this would also include training the smes to better prepare themselves teoh added this is something that is similar to what cedar is doing the organisation currently has a team of 30 people ranging from former entrepreneurs to professionals with knowledge in accounting law and human resources teoh said they plan to

allah swt for with his blessings we are able to gather this morning we also pray for the great prophet muhammad saw 2 we are here this morning with leaders and administrators civil servants industry players and corporate members representatives of embassies ngos and volunteer groups as well as the rakyat in this hall and those watching tv or listening to the speech 3 i would like to address some concerns on the current economic developments and the governments financial position lately there have been reports concerns and queries on issues such as crude oil prices and performance of the ringgit 4 the government has been vigilantly monitoring the situation in this regard i will announce several proactive measures to realign our policies in line with the changing global economic scenario which is beyond our control we are undertaking this to ensure that we continue to achieve creditable growth 5 in other words i am here today to announce specific and proactive measures to align ourselves with the recent global economic developments 6 we are not in crisis indeed we are taking preemptive measures following the changes in the external global economic landscape which is beyond our control 7 this is to ensure that our economy continues to attain a respectable and reasonable growth and at the same time we want to ensure development for the nation and rakyat continues 8 indeed 2014 was a year of trials and tribulations for us due to several tragedies 9 at the end of last year malaysia was hit by unprecedented floods affecting several states including kelantan terengganu pahang kedah and perak 10 although the floods were not so severe in johor sabah and sarawak local communities in some areas were affected 11 thus it is said that while man plans allah swt plans too and allah swt is the best of the planners 12 the government has always done its best to plan formulate and implement policies and measures for the betterment of the rakyat 13 it has been three months since the 2015 budget was tabled the budget was formulated based on first price of dated brent was forecast at usd100 per barrel 14 second gross domestic product gdp growth estimated between 5 and 6 third a stable exchange rate of rm320 against the us dollar and 15 fourth 2015 world economic growth was projected at 34 and 39 by the world bank and imf respectively since then the world bank and the imf have revised global growth to 3 and 38 respectively 16 it should be noted that budget 2015 was formulated based on strong economic fundamentals in 2014 therefore the fiscal deficit was forecast from 35 in 2014 to 3 of gdp in 2015 17 however the external situation has changed lately and we are impacted directly as malaysia is among the largest trading nations in the world 18 compared to the situation a few months ago the global economic landscape has since changed significantly this necessitates us to review and clarify some of our earlier macro and fiscal assumptions 19 among the issues raised is the governments ability to achieve its fiscal targets for 2015 given the current situation the question is whether the economy and governments financial position will be affected 20 in this special address i will explain to the rakyat and announce several measures to mitigate the current economic situation 21 as a responsible government we will continue to ensure economic development and safeguard the wellbeing of the rakyat declining crude oil prices 22 we are aware of the concerns among the rakyat business community and analysts over the impact of the sharp fall in crude oil prices on the domestic economy 23 over the last six months global crude oil prices have plunged more than 50 among others due to oversupply amid weak demand 24 leveraging advances in technology shale oil and gas output has risen significantly in the us 25 the situation is exacerbated by higher output from nonopec organisation of the petroleum exporting countries opec is also not willing to undertake production cuts in order to maintain its market share 26 the government has consistently reiterated that crude oil prices are beyond its control 27 the benchmark dated brent crude oil price has dropped to around usd48 per barrel on 19 january 2015 and analysts expect oil prices to take quite a while to stabilise benefits of declining crude oil prices 28 lower crude oil prices benefit net oil importing countries like malaysia 29 for instance the recent reduction in pump prices of petrol and diesel by 35 sen and 30 sen per litre respectively will increase the overall disposable income of consumers by rm75 billion assuming that consumers spend 40 of this amount it will boost private consumption by rm3 billion 30 the world bank estimates that lower crude oil prices will have a positive impact on world gdp in fact a 30 decline in oil prices could boost global gdp of up to 05 31 this bodes well for malaysias manufactured products further with the us economy strengthening there will be sustained demand for our exports in particular electrical and electronics eampe products falling crude oil prices will reduce federal government revenue 32 in contrast falling crude oil prices will reduce government revenue the revenue is used for development purposes such as building of schools roads and houses of worship it is also used for other expenditures such as salaries of civil servants cost of medicine in government hospitals agriculture subsidies and expenditure for security including armed forces police and rela 33 in 2014 dated brent reached its highest level at usd115 per barrel on 19 june global crude oil prices have since plummeted by more than 50 34 consensus among economists is that the forecast price of usd100 per barrel used in the 2015 budget is no longer realistic they now estimate the average oil price in 2015 to range from usd40 to usd70 per barrel 35 the government has therefore revised downwards its forecast for the average baseline oil price to usd55 per barrel for 2015 36 based on the crude oil price of usd100 per barrel coupled with savings following the implementation of the managed float pricing mechanism for retail fuel prices effective from december 2014 the government is expected to get an additional operating surplus of rm37 billion 37 if crude oil price remains at usd100 per barrel the government will be able to accommodate all the measures announced in budget 2015 with the fiscal deficit target not exceeding 3 of gdp 38 however at the forecast price of usd55 per barrel there will be a revenue shortfall of rm138 billion 39 if we compare the revised figures with budget 2015 tabled in october last year despite the savings of rm107 billion from the implementation of the managed float mechanism for retail fuel prices the government still faces a revenue shortfall of rm83 billion to accommodate the 2015 budget measures 40 without any fiscal measures the deficit will increase to 39 of gdp against the target of 3 for 2015 41 this requires the government to take measures to reduce the deficit in line with the governments commitment towards fiscal consolidation 42 therefore taking into account the revised estimates we are revising the fiscal deficit target to 32 of gdp in 2015 43 this is still lower than the fiscal deficit of 35 of gdp in 2014 in view of the external factors we have to acknowledge that we may not be able to achieve the earlier fiscal target of 3 of gdp as announced of importance is our commitment to continue reducing the fiscal deficit from 35 of gdp 44 more importantly we will not compromise on national development planning as it will enhance productive capacity of the economy we will not neglect the rakyats welfare particularly the bottom 40 of households volatile capital flows and ringgit 45 the fluctuations in the ringgit are influenced by developments in the global economy hence the ringgit is not the only currency to have weakened against the us dollar in fact almost all currencies in the region have softened against the us dollar since september 2014 46 the recent volatile capital flows and significant depreciation of the ringgit were also due to concerns over the impact of the sharp fall in oil prices on the malaysian economy 47 in relation to this we must closely monitor the following first the current account in the balance of payments must remain in surplus second continue with fiscal reforms and consolidation and third economic activity must be further diversified to enable us to cope with falling crude oil and commodity prices 48 the government is confident that the exchange rate will over time adjust to reflect the strong economic fundamentals of importance our financial system continues to function in an orderly manner 49 most importantly there has been no disruption to financial intermediation with lending activities continuing smoothly businesses continue to have access to financing from banking institutions and the capital market 50 in essence greater policy flexibility adequate international reserves deeper and more diversified financial markets sound banking system and strong domestic institutional investors such as the employees provident fund will increase resilience to volatile capital flows current account balance 51 the current account balance is directly related to the import and export of goods and services 52 we are a crude oil exporter thus when oil prices plummeted recently there was a perception that export receipts will also decline drastically and result in a current account deficit 53 indeed this perception is not correct as a net crude oil exporter we had a surplus of rm77bil from january to november 2014 54 however we are an importer of petroleum products with a net import bill of rm89bil during the same period 55 if we include both crude oil and petroleum products we are actually a net importer with a deficit of rm12bil 56 therefore the perception that malaysia is a large oil producer is also not true 57 however if we factor in exports and imports of crude oil and nett out petroleum products then malaysia is a net importer of petroleum this does not include lng for which malaysia is a net exporter 58 furthermore we are still resilient as our diversified economy is able to weather the decline in oil prices 59 with a better outlook for the global economy in 2015 the shortfall in commodity receipts is expected to be cushioned by increased demand for manufactured goods such as electrical and electronic products woodbased products textile products and others which account for 76 of total exports meanwhile crude oil exports account for only 45 of total exports 60 therefore the government is confident that the current account will remain in surplus this year although smaller in the range of 2 to 3 of gross national income or gni in 2014 the current account balance is estimated to record a surplus at 51 of gni strategies to strengthen economic resilience 61 as i have explained earlier there are several issues which will impact the domestic economy significantly in the light of this the government will take measures to ensure economic growth remains on a strong trajectory we are confident of achieving gdp growth in the range of 45  55 this year with the implementation of the following strategies  first ensure balanced inclusive and sustainable economic growth  second continue fiscal reforms and consolidation and  third provide assistance to the rakyat and business community to rebuild infrastructure damaged by floods 62 first strategy ensuring balanced inclusive and sustainable economic growth to boost exports of goods and services the following measures will be taken first actively promote

and  postpone the scheduled gas price hike for the industrial sector in 2015 fourth allocate 30 of the annual procurement budget of government agencies and glcs for goods and services to local sme producers and fifth increase local goods and services in government procurement 63 second strategy continuing fiscal reforms and consolidation among the revenue enhancement measures include first broaden the tax base by encouraging companies to register with the royal malaysian customs to enable them to charge and collect gst this is expected to contribute an additional rm1 billion in gst collection as at midjanuary 2015 more than 304000 companies have registered and second realise additional dividends from glcs and glics as well as other government entities amounting to rm400mil the government will undertake the following expenditure rationalisation measures first optimise outlays on supplies and services especially overseas travel events and functions and use of professional services this will result in savings of rm16bil second defer the 2015 program latihan khidmat negara to enable the programme to be reviewed and enhanced with savings expected at rm400 million third review transfers and grants to statutory bodies glcs and government trust funds particularly those with a steady revenue stream and high reserves this measure will result in savings of rm32 billion and fourth reschedule the purchase of noncritical assets especially office equipment software and vehicles with an expected savings of rm300 million 64 third strategy assisting the rakyat and business community as well as rebuilding infrastructure damaged by the floods the recent floods affected around 400000 people nationwide the latest estimate of damage to infrastructure is about rm29bil among the measures that have been taken and will be implemented to assist flood victims include the government has provided an initial allocation of rm500 million for rehabilitation works and welfare programmes for flood victims this is in addition to the existing allocation to the national security council bringing the total to rm787mil provide an initial allocation of rm800mil for repair and

challenging external developments which are beyond our control this is a reality check following among others declining global crude oil prices third the current account balance is expected to remain

to ease the governments financial burden during the budget speech it was mentioned that the government would appoint panels from commercial banks to manage new housing loans effective january 2013\\xa0 but this had yet to implemented said a local research house\\xa0 the research house reckoned the staff housing loans would be transferred to governmentowned development financial institutions such as bank rakyat bank simpanan nasional agro bank and bank pembangunan which will manage and administer the existing stock and future stream of civil service home loans\\xa0 another a

last year have only had a marginal impact on slowing down the rise in total household debt to 130 in 2012 from 134 in 2011  certain measures therefore have to be in place in combination with the

release it issued on july 16 in response to a starbiz report on the reprimandthe firms explanation is that there is a clash of opinions on whether it was right to believe that the pie was a going concern back when its 2010 accounts were auditedsaid the press release uhy elaborated that the particular pie was merely undergoing a recapitalisation exercise where the focus on uhys decision to concur with its clients going concern assumption has been an area that the aob differs in terms of its technical view of the matter uhy believes it has strong grounds to appeal the aob decision as the differing views are judgemental in naturea fundamental principle in the preparation of financial statements the going concern assumption simply means that the management of an organisation has no reason to believe that the organisations operations will come to a halt in the foreseeable futurewhen doing an audit the auditor has to decide whether the use of the going concern assumption is appropriatethe aob has not responded to the uhy statement although when speaking to starbiz earlier aob executive chairman nik mohamed hasyudeen yusoff took pains to point out that the reprimand didnt

doing enough to assess the appropriateness of the going concern assumption although there were signs of going concern issues lack of evidence that the auditors had challenged key assumptions used by management to support the basis for going concern and a majority of auditors failing to perform an independent stress test or sensitivity analysisthe board then became specific in three instances there were disclosures in the financial statements or managements representation letter which point to significant doubt or dependence of a future event to support their ability to continue operating as going concern entities however the audit opinion did not reflect the substance of such disclosuresin another instance while an emphasis of matter opinion relating to going concern was issued the description of the facts supporting the opinion gave a different connotation as though there was no default in debt obligationssome of these issues observed in the 2010 inspections persisted the following year judging from the comments in the aobs annual report 2011the aob reiterates the need for assessing the fundamental assumptions of going concern made by management in the preparation of financial statements audit firms need to improve in this area as our inspection revealed that the performance of audit procedures is generally lacking said the board in the latest annual reportit is important to acknowledge that going concern considerations involve risks of key judgment area especially when the managements assessment may not be realisticclearly this is an area that calls for professional scepticism something that auditors are expected to exercise in spades in the course of their workthere is no easy way to determine how sceptical an auditor should be in assessing the

responsibility from our viewpoint and after deliberation at the board level this is the right measure to take in these particular situations based on the facts of these cases if we had felt that the

considerable fragmentation of market share among the smaller banks with the three large local banks accounting for nearly 4045 of assets in the malaysian banking sectorthe three small local banks

shrinkage and while the local pie is shrinking via this consolidation process licences are issued to a host of global commercial and islamic banks from overseasaccording to chia these moves to consolidate and at the same time expand certain niches are specifically targetedthere are new segments that are underserved and a need to cater for the changes arising from asean integration as well

redefine customer engagement and relationship management for the banking industry says chia of hong leongdatuk seri abdul wahid omar president and ceo of maybank does not see these two trends  consolidation and expansion  as contradictorythe need for the banking industry to expand will be there as long as consumer and business demand grow to expand the economy and in turn it is the banking sector that also drives the economy he saysas malaysia becomes a developed economy it is the larger banks with their economies of scale and scope that will have the ability to provide a wider range of products and services at a lower costfor this to happen the industry will have to go through a consolidation phase where banks will grow not just organically but through acquisition of smaller banks says wahidthe major issue is ensuring that the right banks are merged there must be a business fit that complements each other with as little duplication as possible reducing this duplication will take time given that retrenchments or relocation of employees could have regulatory restrictions as seen in the previous consolidation of 19992002 where banks were not allowed to retrench staff for two years following a mergerexperience has shown that banks can often see a decline in productivity upon a merger and in practice mergers can take two to three years before they become value accretive depending also on the valuation of the acquisitionin the interim if investors see greater value elsewhere the resulting depressed share price could have negative implications for example in raising capital says an analystanother issue for smaller banks in attracting foreign banks to become a strategic partner is that the limit on foreign shareholding could be a hindrance although this could be resolved on a case by case basis as indicated by bank negarajegarasasingam of marc cautions against small malaysian banks from expanding into regional markets which are generally risky and complex to managein consolidation exercises heavy competition among potential acquirers may at times result in a substandard due diligence exercise arising from the eagerness to close the deal ahead of competitors he saysany merger or acquisition should not merely be driven by attractive pricing such deals should also be evaluated in terms of the potential value proposition and the effort required for extracting results out of the deal he adds   future directionwith so many measures taken to boost islamic banking repositioning the banking system in the competitive global arena as the international islamic financial centre has become a priority says promodhe also expects some relaxation of foreign equity ownership in domestic banks removal of some existing restrictions on locally

reliability of audited financial statements in malaysia suffer because the audit fees dont correspond to the amount and nature of work required to do a good job this mismatch is a common complaint among the auditors we often hear them lamenting that the fees in malaysia are on the low side for an example of this read our up close amp personal interview with kpmg malaysia managing partner mohamed raslan abdul rahman on page 6the maiden annual report of the audit oversight board aob issued on thursday has amplified the issue when highlighting the key findings from its inspections of the six largest audit firms in the country the board points out that auditors need to price their services at levels that will ensure that they can comply with the requirements of auditing and ethical standards the worry here is that firms may decide on the resources to be deployed for audit engagements based on the fees they will earn rather than on the risks that need to be addressed when auditing the accountsin its annual report the aob relays the grouse of audit firms that due to the relatively low audit fees in malaysia it is a big challenge for them to secure adequate resources considering that the aob was set up to assist the securities commission in regulating auditors of public interest entities pies its telling that the board saw this matter as worthy of a mention but does this mean that the authorities agree that the auditors are not being paid enough for their servicesif youre bent on getting an unambiguous answer to that good luck to you the board will only go as far as to emphasise that the fees should be properly tied to the audit work that ought to be done it says in the annual report the aob is mindful that the global economy is still in a recovery stage this will continue to place pressure on pies to contain their operating costs including audit fees nevertheless the aob expects auditors to price their fees to commensurate with the risks undertaken so as not to compromise on audit qualitypies include listed companies banking and financial institutions including islamic banks and development financial institutions insurance companies and takaful operators and holders of capital market services licences such as securities and futures trading firms and fund management companieswhen fielding questions from reporters after releasing the report aob executive chairman mohamed nik hasyudeen yusoff stopped short of endorsing the view that companies in malaysia should get used to the idea of paying higher audit fees he said the board would not tell the firms what to charge clients and would leave this to the market forces to decide instead he urged companies to look at audit fees as an investment rather than as a cost because the work of auditors supports the enhancement of a companys valueto help audit firms in determining fees the malaysian institute of accountants have something called a guide to charging for professional assurance services it says fee arrangement is a matter for commercial negotiation by practitioners the institute does not prescribe the mandatory basis for calculating fees nor does it ordinarily investigate complaints relating solely to the quantum of fees chargedthe level of fee is to be mutually agreed between the auditor and his client which largely depends upon the skill and knowledge required level of training and experience of the staff involved the time necessarily occupied and the degree of responsibility and urgency of work involvedhowever this rpg recommended practice guide is useful as a benchmark to establish the reasonable level of remuneration commensurate with the provision of professional services of an acceptable and recognised standard in the absence of other more sophisticated billing methodologythe problem is not many firms make full use of the rpg hence we continue to hear the auditors grumbling about the fees perhaps their best hope is that the aob framework will bring about desirable changesthe strategy here is that the aob inspections will compel the firms to improve their compliance with the standards and consequently the firms will turn to their clients and say look well get into trouble with the regulators if our audit work falls short of the requirements of the standards we wont cut corners and we wont reduce the scope of the work our fees have to be rightsized if you dont want to pay that much find auditors who are willing to risk being slapped with sanctions by the aobof course such a transition in mindset will take time meanwhile lets see how the aob handles the errant firms that has no qualms about bending the rules to fit the fees the annual report has this to say it has been a known area of concern that the provision of nonaudit services by audit firms to their listed audit clients may result in auditors lowballing their audit fees to gain more consulting jobs at clients and this may compromise

has pinpointed a number of shortcomings after inspecting the countrys six largest audit firms last year this raises the possibility of the board finding more areas of concern when it widens its inspection coverage to include smaller firms this yearaob executive chairman nik mohd hasyudeen yusoff said the board was targeting to inspect 18 audit firms this year including midtier and small firms we will have a better picture of where everybody is in the financial reporting ecosystem he told reporters after the release of the aobs maiden annual report yesterdayhe described the inspections and the resulting remediation as the most important part of the boards work this is where we try to influence the quality of audit when we understand where the firms are lacking and where they can improve he saidlast year the aob used a riskbased approach to select the six firms for inspection these firms are the big four pricewaterhousecoopers kpmg ernst amp young and deloitte and two others with more than 10 partners the board did not name the latter but according to its register of auditors bdo and crowe horwath are the only firms apart from the big four that have more than 10

the companies on bursa malaysia pies include listed companies banking and financial institutions including islamic banks and development financial institutions insurance companies and takaful operators and holders of capital market services licences such as securities and futures trading firms and fund management companiessaid nik mohd hasyudeen we have decided that the six firms will continue be inspected annually because of the impact of their work whereas the others will each be inspected every three years but that depends on what we find during the inspections because we may have to conduct followup inspectionsin his message in the annual report he wrote while we determined that the audit firms inspected had put in place systems and processes in line with global best practices some specific areas for improvements were identified the aob will follow up on the remediation efforts of the audit firms to ensure substantive changes are effected to enhance audit qualitythe report said the inspections had identified a number of shortcomings that needed to be addressed by the firms particularly in the area of audit documentation and evidence for significant judgement areasif a firm doesnt document its work there is no basis for us to confirm that the firm has performed its function one of the principles that we have adopted in our inspections is that if you fail to document we will consider that you have not done the audit procedure this is a very strong position that we have taken added nik mohd hasyudeensaid the aob in the annual report other than instances where there was insufficient documentation for the audit evidence obtained there were instances where the necessary audit procedures and evidence were clearly not performed or obtained it is pertinent to recognise that without sufficient evidence and analysis the auditor may not have a basis to support their opinionthe board also called on the auditors to be more robust and to apply professional scepticism in challenging management assumptions and estimates particularly in areas that require significant professional judgement such as in determining fair value asset impairment and going concernhe said these were highly subjective areas and pointed out that the value of the audit work came from the auditors exercising professional scepticism to objectively and independently arrive at audit opinionsanother key observation by the aob following last years inspections was the need for audit firms to price their services at levels that commensurated with the risks undertaken so as not to compromise on audit qualitythe annual report also highlighted that human resource was an important factor in ensuring high quality audit including ensuring appropriate workload of partners and other members of the audit team as well as attracting new talent through a conducive work environmentnik mohd hasyudeen said the board had yet to determine if the issues uncovered in last years inspection would lead to inquiries and possible sanctions he explained our main focus is to work with the firms on remediation that is very critical if we have identified areas for improvement we need to get that resolved immediately rather than to prolong the situation given that we just completed the inspections in december we are still looking at a number of issues if we were to impose

not become a source of financial instability a comprehensive series of policies were introduced during the course of the year these include prudential policies applied in the residential property sector new credit card measures and strengthened requirements for banks to adopt prudent and responsible lending practices this was reinforced by more intensive supervisory oversight of financial institutions with respect to the management of household lending portfolios she saysthe governor adds in her statement that more targeted financial education programmes as well as advisory and support arrangements have also served to promote responsible borrowing by households these preemptive and more holistic measures also aim to contribute towards further strengthening the resilience of the

indicate demand for housing loans is starting to cool banks are paying more attention to applications of borrowers to weed out speculative borrowing but the impact will only be known in the march data

were those earning an annual income of rm36000 and below it says in the reportmeanwhile the level of nonperforming loans npls ratio for credit cards issued by banks and nonbanks remained low at 17the next step bank negara is taking is to stresstest individual borrowers to gauge if they can afford a new loan once new guidelines are introduced in the third quarter of this yearthe new guidelines are designed to inculcate responsible lending practices by financial institutions when dealing with retail customers where borrowers will be subject to a suitability and affordability assessment and verification of incomethe reason for that is while there are education programmes to inform young borrowers about getting into debt and how to manage their finances clamps need to be also put in place

second in a threepart questionandanswer series provided by pricewaterhousecoopers for the star readers on various aspects of budget 2005 the final part will appear in starbiz tomorrow\\xa0q the finance minister in presenting his 2005 budget speech spoke on establishing a fund for tax refund can you explain what is the effect \\xa0 a when the government introduced assessment on the currentyear basis as well as the self assessment system sas there are companies which have made excess payments on their tax these companies are entitled to claim refund from the government\\xa0 up to now there has been no change in the procedure of paying refund as tax collected under the income tax act goes into the consolidated fund and cannot be used to make refund \\xa0 the inland revenue board irb has to obtain the necessary fund from the treasury if the treasury does not provide the fund the irb would not be in a position to make the refund \\xa0 with the establishment of a fund for tax refund tax collected can be allocated into the fund as determined by the finance minister directly and the irb would be allowed to utilise the monies from the fund to make refund\\xa0 this will certainly improve the governments delivery system as refunds will be made in a shorter period\\xa0  q the finance minister has announced that there will be changes in claiming the industrial building allowance for purchase of a used industrial building my company intends to buy a used building to expand its activities can you advise me how the proposed change will impact my claim on the industrial building\\xa0 a the proposed change is to overcome the difficulty faced by the taxpayer ie the acquirer of the used industrial building in computing the annual allowance ie industrial building allowance iba \\xa0 based on the current law the acquirer of a used building can claim iba based on the tax residual value of the construction cost ie construction cost less allowances claimed to date the acquirer would have to obtain the information on the construction cost from the vendor the acquirer may have difficulty in obtaining the information \\xa0 the proposed change in law is to simplify the claim for iba as the basis of the computation of iba will be calculated on the current purchase price notwithstanding that the disposer will be subject to the balancing allowance or balancing charge in your case say if the purchase price of the building is rm1mil the company will be entitled to claim initial allowance of 10 and annual allowance of 3 in the year of acquisition \\xa0 q the recent budget proposed that interestinsuspense be deemed as specific provision for bad debts and allowed a full deduction in the computation of income tax does this apply to stockbroking companies\\xa0 a section 34 of the income tax act 1967 ita governs the tax treatment of provision for doubtful debts the new section 34 subsection 3b of the income tax act 1967 defines a bank as a bank or finance company or a banking and finance company licensed or deemed to be licensed under the banking and financial institutions act 1989 or islamic banking act 1983 or an institution prescribed under the development financial institutions act 2002 stockbroking companies appear not to be covered by the above provision\\xa0  q the government has increased the duty for cigarettes again this year  as a smoker can i know how much will the price of cigarettes be increased\\xa0 a the 2005 budget has announced a change in the duty structure for cigarettes the changes in the rate of import duty and excise duty are as follows\\xa0 old import duty rm200kg new import duty rm020stick\\xa0 old excise duty rm58kg new excise duty rm811000 sticks \\xa0 the minister of finance in his budget speech mentioned an increase in excise duty rates to promote a healthy lifestyle the increase in excise duty to be around 40 for imported as well as locally manufactured cigarettes the increase in the excise duty would also increase the amount of sales tax paid \\xa0 the impact of the increase on the consumer would ultimately depend on how much of the increase will be passed down by the tobacco manufacturers and importers the higher costs will increase the incidence of cigarette smuggling and would have to be addressed by the authorities \\xa0 q the abolishment of the import duty on semifinished components for the woodbased industry would benefit the construction industry would this benefit be passed on to the property buyers\\xa0 a although construction costs are expected to be reduced in the case where imported components are used the benefit may be minimal it would be up to the developers to determine how much of the reduction if any to be passed to the property buyers \\xa0 q it was anticipated that budget 2005 will be a caring budget  how will budget 2005 benefit the man in the street\\xa0 a the proposals that will benefit individual taxpayers at large include the following which will come into effect beginning in year of assessment 2005\\xa0 ·the relief for the purchase of books to increase from rm500 to rm700 to promote the reading habit\\xa0 ·the limit on relief for epf contributions andfor insurance premium to be increased from rm5000 to rm6000 and\\xa0 ·the rebate for the purchase of a personal computer to increase from rm400 to rm500 to promote the

rijal\\xa0amid the expectation that a successful revamp of governmentlinked companiesglcs will boost the stock marketit is easy to forget that not all ofthese companies are listed for thatmatter some of them will never getto bursa malaysia simply becausemaking profits is not their raisondêtre\\xa0however even for these companies there is no escaping the mounting pressure to perform better bank industri amp teknologi malaysia bhd knows all about this it celebrated its 25th anniversary last month but this year is meaningful not just because of the silverjubilee\\xa0undercapitalised and burdened by the highrisk lending it is called upon to provide bank industri is reshaping itself the restructuring is expected to be completed by the yearend\\xa0the idea is to become stronger in dealing with changes in the financial services business and in the strategic sectors that the bank focuses on\\xa0over the years the banks basic role has been the same – to give medium to longterm financing to strategic capitalintensive industries what have changed significantly are the nature of these industries and the ability of the domestic capital market to finance their businesses\\xa0bank industri chairman tan sri othman mohd rijal says the bank must reposition itself to continue to be effective in its role as a development financial institution dfi thatsupports these strategic sectors he points out that the bank has to keep up with rapid advances in hightechnology industries so that it can continue to offer financialproducts that meet the demand of these industries\\xa0in addition dfis are perhaps no longer the no1 option when a highrisk business needs financing venture capital and debt securities have become reliable alternatives\\xa0for bank industri restructuring is a necessary response says chairman tan sri othman mohd rijal we have to repair and clean our balance sheet and address capitaladequacy issues of course we next have to improve the banks organisational structure processes and operations\\xa0the basis of the exercise is an ongoing review done jointly with professional service firm kpmg and rating agency malaysia bhd ram a development that was instrumental in pushing the bank towards some serious selfexamination was the enactment of the development financial institutions act which took effect in february 2002\\xa0following this the bank and two main subsidiaries exportimport bank of malaysia bhd exim bank and malaysia export creditinsurance bhd mecib came under bank negaras supervision along with that came the inevitable comparison with other players in the banking sector\\xa0at the same time the governments push to reform glcs including the introduction of kpis key performance indicators addsimpetus to bank industris restructuring efforts\\xa0we welcome this initiative because it brings the management and direction of the business in line with what is stipulated in the act which essentially emphasises goodmanagement prudential risk management and of course capital adequacy othman explains\\xa0the dfi difference\\xa0when stacked up against say the countrys commercial banks bank industri looks very much like a poor cousin the latters riskweighted capital ratio rwcr is 29 a negative ratio means that the capital base is insufficient to cover the assets including loans and its net nonperforming loans npl ratio as at june was 135\\xa0according to bank negaras july statistics the commercial bankss rwcr and net npl ratio stood at 142 and 58 the overall banking system had a rwcr of 139 and anet npl ratio of 62\\xa0however because bank industri is a dfi there is room to argue that it and commercial banks do not even belong to the same family in a way we are a slightly different creature says othman\\xa0in a few ways actually to begin with the bank was set up in 1979 to fill a gap in the financial system back then commercial banks were reluctant – and understandably still are – to take on the high risk thatcomes with lending to certain businesses in the maritime and manufacturing industries\\xa0but these industries were deemed important to the nations development goals and thus dfis like bank industri were required tofinance such businesses naturally that has led to a loan portfolio that has a disproportionate amount of assets of lesser quality\\xa0says othman if we were to apply prudence in the same way it is applied among commercial banks we wouldnt be lending anything\\xa0another key difference is that bank industri was left out in the restructuring of the banking sector in the wake of the asian financial crisis for example it did notreceive capital injection from danamodal nasional bhd but it is clear that there is a need to address the banks weak rwcr\\xa0indeed the bank has sought fresh capital from the government – minister of finance inc owns bank industri – and at one time had apparently fancied its chances of getting a positive response in a rating review published last march ram says it had been given to understand that the government had agreed to restore the rwcr toat least 8 according to the rating agency that would need a capital injection of about rm800mil\\xa0the governments plan to recapitalise the bank is viewed positively by ram although we believe that it may take some time before the actual capital injection takes placesays the report\\xa0it will be a long wait bank industri is now resigned to making do without recapitalisation by the government othman says the capital injection is not likely to happen because the government is now intent on balancing the budget i think we have to figure out ways how to repair the banks capital structure ourselves\\xa0floating to the top\\xa0in that respect it helps that bank industri has some useful investments on its books last december for example it unlocked substantial value when malaysian bulk carriers bhd a joint venture with the kuokgroup was floated on bursa malaysias main board\\xa0through subsidiary global maritime ventures bhd gmv bank industri still holds over 20 in the shipping company its alreadylisted and we will harvest the proceeds from there says othman\\xa0in addition the bank is banking on gaining from the possible flotation of another shipping business according to gmvs 2003 annual report it operated 12 vessels injoint venture with wawasan shipping sdn bhd a unit of the imc group which is controlled by shipping magnate tan sri frank tsao\\xa0the listing proposal is still in the planning stages but bank industri hopes to reap almost rm1bil in cash flow when it eventually disposes of its shares in the two shipping companies\\xa0that should bring us to a positive rwcr of 14 to 18 depending on how we package the deals thats way above the minimum banknegara requirement of 8 othman says we consider ourselves very lucky because we have made very good investments that are maturing at the right time but he concedesthat the bank cannot depend on lady luck to bail it out the next time\\xa0he says because of the kind of lending it does and the portfolio it carries it may well be back to square one in a matter of a few years he adds that the bank shouldbe compensated by other measures if a capital injection is not forthcoming\\xa0the rwcr formula is a source of contention the banks group managing director datuk md noor yusoff says the formula requires thebanks investment in subsidiaries to be taken out of the banks capital base\\xa0he argues we have to create so many subsidiaries given our small capital we have to borrow from the market to increase it the ratio is negative but we still continue our operations like normal and theinvestments in the subsidiaries are still good investments\\xa0othman takes a somewhat different approach he views it as a positive that bank industri is included in the authorities moves to strengthen the countrys banking systemand culture at the same time he feels that bank industris responsibility for supporting highrisk ventures has to be taken into account\\xa0the standards as applied by bank negara relates to the business of lending and finance you cant use a different measurement a measurement is a measurement thats it youve got to accept that\\xa0but when the subject matter doesnt really fit into the framework of standards you have to look into what can be done to remedythat at policy and structural levelswhen asked if the bank has figured out the remedial measures othman says this is being done as part of the strategic review\\xa0whether the government will accept it the banks proposal or whether it has other approaches i wouldnt know\\xa0related storya major role in the countrys development',

for consumers and businesses public bank bhd said in its economic review\\xa0 in the short term the economic package will result in higher consumer spending arising from the direct income support measures which will increase households disposable income\\xa0 these measures include the rm17bil direct spending by the government a halfmonth bonus for civil servants reduction in the workers employees provident fund contribution a cut in the intervention rate as well as tax and nontax incentives for purchase of property\\xa0 the review said that the extent to which these measures would affect consumer spending depended partly on the size of the consumption multiplier of the economy\\xa0 it would also depend on the speed at which consumers would be spending their additional income\\xa0 the report also noted that while the economic package to boost the domestic economy in the short run would result in higher fiscal deficit the government still continued to maintain a strong fiscal discipline\\xa0 \\x93the increased fiscal deficit which by our estimation will be around 47 of the gross domestic product is not expected to weaken the economy and create fiscal difficulties in the long run\\xa0 \\x93in fact the estimate indicates that the fiscal deficit for the current year is significantly lower than the 56 deficit in 2002\\x94 it said\\xa0 the report said the impact of the economic package on private investment and business activity would come mainly from two major sources\\xa0 it said the first source was through greater consumer spending which would translate into higher industrial production and thus business spending particularly by domesticoriented industries\\xa0 the second source was through the investment promoting measures it said\\xa0 this include the additional funds allocated for small and mediumscale enterprises smes through bank negara funds loan programmes including micro credit schemes by the development financial institutions and the liberal conditions for tax incentives for small companies\\xa0 under this package viable smes will continue to have access to capital and enjoy better incentives\\xa0 the report said that in addition to the greater accessibility to credit business spending was expected to increase due to the lower interest rates and the tax incentives provided in the package\\xa0 it said that
